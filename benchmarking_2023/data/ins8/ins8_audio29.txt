for my partner and i to make our living room what we considered cosier and our bedroom like what we considered cosy is very nice like before going to bed i used to look at her now i now i look at the corner that i that is but i look at her in the morning lah okay okay okay yeah okay and we are back for another episode of peox ya and we are here to talk about housing cause we are all our first time house owners okay maybe you all can say your um type of housing you know maybe your marital status that kind of stuff so my name is pei fang and then um i am 28 this year attached not married yet i i am getting a flat in jurong east in 5 years i'm in 2028 i'm ben i'm 32 this year i'm married and i have a resale flat in punggol yeah i just moved in like two months ago mm mm um bella 35 i stay in a private condo um it's a studio apartment was pretty small swimming pool swimming pool ya lah hi my name is you heng uh i'm 30 this year i'm recently engaged my b t o is in tampines yeah ya tampines yes tampines che family silence no one cheer for him myself yes tampines okay so we're gonna play this game called like would you rather lah so there are certain like options here so would you rather a spend less for a less ideal location or would you be pay more for an ideal location so who is a ya ya maybe they did really spend less compared to us okay so you all say you all pay less or less ideal location so what do you all forgo and your choice uh not choosing tiong bahru over jurong east oh ya i was like at the top of my head before saying like the price i was like tiong bahru cause like the tiong bahru curry rice to eat the stall move you also move no but there's just like a greater proportion of like good food in that area ya then the estate got also looks very like um nice and all like very chill vibes that kind of thing but um my situation is not ideal in a sense that i don't um earn that much for me to afford that location so i need to like prioritise on whatever i can afford lah so i decided to go for like jurong east cause i think jurong east is like there's a lot of like shopping malls and like a lot of amenities there also but location ah issue and issue so actually my location is quite ideal already because uh i think when my partner and i were discussing right we kind of wanted either bedok or tampines we like tampines lah but we forgot a lot of things for us we weren't expecting to get a flat during the exercise but we did and when when it was our turn to choose a flat we didn't have high floor options left so i mean as much as we wanted to also stay like thirty floor that kind right we don't have a choice lah so that's one thing that we have to forgo ya those are the things that unfortunately i can't choose but my price is quite healthy lah for me to think about so i don't feel anxious thinking oh my goodness i need to pay so much ah i think for me location is one of the primary consideration your location how much mm okay not punggol per se but like like within the estate i wanted something that was more accessible and had like facilities or amenities nearby what's important for you i think commit to work for one yeah i think that was the main thing that my father and i were looking at mm mm mm yeah some space like that commut work is further sa and then you also stay near your parents correct yeah so i stayed within just nice within the 4km ra so i managed to get the proximity housing grant as well ya so i think i was just like within 100 metres if i throw a stone already the stone won't get the so since you all say you all pay less for a less ideal location i don't know like how much did your house cost like roughly mine was about 320k for four room flat that's a good number one about it enough uh around it's similar to your cost um 370 ah okay okay i'm quite envious when i hear all the retail prices so mine is resale right so i paid about close to half a million there about for four room no but then you get your flat faster also e you move in already but still waiting we are still waiting you know you just see the like the paper the floor then i s five years later see you that kind wah i don't think i can eh to like commit that and like you just see the model i don't know when you think about the course you can commit already thanks so so what about the cost for you okay so ya lah here 300 500 then like i damn sian ah am i stupid for doing this because you all have partners then i bought this like as a single uh so my place for studio apartment which is like damn tiny is uh 700 700k when i hear all of your amounts it's like oh my god it's like more than double of i can buy two btoos tomorrow flat where is it you know i think i should make more friends in the east alright you can move here change your b t o no no no then i'll invite you all to the west also i think people won't go but okay you can try let me know in five years i put it on my account oh ya my house i we are still friends in five years time okay would you rather buy a resale flat or private property to move in earlier or b buy a b t o and move in later sorry i need to read the i'm speaking properly and you cannot register okay who is a i'm half half eh i cannot ya half half i mean clearly i bought a resale because i wanted the convenience of being able to move in right now right but at the same time i see the benefits of having a detail whereby you get something at the plus subsidised rate ya you you do have to wait but it saves you a lot of money in the long run as well my spouse and i we've been renting for a couple of years already so we are very used to having our own space you know i i love living with my parents and i and i appreciate them for for all that but i also really like having my space so i don't think it's something that i can go back to so i think we would still go for resale actually i think that's quite a great point because a lot of uh couples want that freedom also like for us for me and my partner sometimes we will we will just like randomly chatboard things and we will think about how nice it is if we had our own space now right yeah yeah okay the situation around me getting my video was that it was a decision that we we didn't expect to make because it wasn't a very ideal unit lah for her and she really like the dream home she envisioned wasn't like facing a carpark on the fourth floor yeah so why did your partner decide to keep the flat okay so after discussing for four months right i think one fine day she just woke up and she's like you know what let's just try to make this home the best home we can then if even if we don't like it down the road if like she cannot stand like you know the car park noises or whatever we will just find a new place to live like it's not like we have to commit to something at this point of life it's the idea that you make your dream home not that theo is given to you so would you rant before you get your video i haven't really thought of that question leh so like just now when you all talking about it i was like thinking at the back of my head like wah should i rant or not cause a lot of people have ask me also and they are like five years you will be like 30 30 plus like in in that time already then how to start a family blah blah blah that kind of thing you're too old for that then i'm like i like thanks for the reminder like i know it at all like i don't know like maybe an alternative is to similar to um he's case is my boyfriend will just come over and like live with me i mean i haven't like brought up that topic and all cause um it's not something that we are considering at that moment ah mm you also haven't proposed yet ya lor right how can where's your proposal where's your proposal okay i haven't even like talk to him like so i think for bella um she mentioned just now that she needs to pay 700k right like in a lump not not really a lump sum ya still don't have the 700k but ya ya correct so for us like at least we get like the the e h g grant enhanced housing grant so basically is a grant given by uh h d b for you to offset some of the cost of financing your house lah i mean your house cost like 700k right so how do you afford it i can't afford it sometimes i wonder too no lah i think it's a commitment that you you decided on right so there will be certain life changes ah like previously i always thought of you know every few years i will live a year overseas um but now with a house then you have to ask yourself you know can you afford it or like i must always have a job but definitely like having such a big financial commitment is is huge lah then just gonna make adjustments to my lifestyle lor i cancelled disney plus subscription no lah just really just take note of like every single month like now i have a table of like all my expenditure and all the loans i have to pay and then i feel like a lot of people don't i mean the people i know at least right didn't think about that until they committed to a housing option like for example they will be like oh ya i can afford it but then when they go for the housing option that they want then they realise oh now i have to like change a lot to my life if you haven't gotten a house it it's a good idea to start thinking about all these things first lah i wish i i all that more got the planner no no she she's a my partner is a planner i wasn't ya because if she didn't kick start the whole process of like let's plan of finances right i would have a lot more anxious about my house so the idea that that you know we have to sit down and think about okay if we want to afford this what should our life look like uh what should our lifestyle be like are you ready for the last one yes this one looks very long so pei fang should slowly digest and tell us my digest first ah would you rather buy your dream house as your first home and stay there in the long run hobby buy a this time i a bit ugly but hobby buy a starter home and upgrade at a later time wah starter home like minecraft eh sia i think this is a a for me at the moment you buy your dream house and stay in the long run in my current situation is a a for me okay but is that what you have i saw your dream house at tiong bahru please dream is one then this is dream a2 so still dream house still can consider dream house lah yeah happy for you yeah yeah yeah i mean their okay tiong bahru is dream a one because of the location yeah location is ideal yeah yeah but jurong east is a2 because um the location is not as ideal as tiong bahru but the height is grey yes it's grey yes so it's still considered dream okay that's my definition so so why then why why did why were you like this is starter and i mean cause is a big thing lah obviously like for example her dream home i said it's a condo right but given our current finances it's a bit hard for us to look at a condo and be like i want to buy it then your my dream home is as long as it's nice and it has a very nice kitchen i'm happy with it but unfortunately that also means that a lot of condos right because their kitchen is very small right ya so we do have to like we our pros and cons lah yeah but happy wife happy life she want it for you your home is my ba is that's correct my great home is where my where my wife is where my future wife is trying to be boy ya boyfriend of the year i cannot take it and i think the bonus of having a video that a lot of people don't necessarily think about is the fact that like waiting isn't bad thing waiting means that you have time to build up your finances you have time to to progress in your career to a more stable place so that when you actually get the house you don't feel anxious about a lot of things okay or ben you just recently moved in so was it very exciting like seeing everything done up like how you planned it to be yes like it's nice to be able to finally decorate and like make something your own or like you know everyone has a different idea of cosy so for us like for my partner and i to make our living room what we consider coier and our bedroom like what we considered cosy is very nice like like before going to bed i used to look at her now i now i look at the corner that i that is but i look at her in the morning so as first time house owners like what you're most excited about i want to pay for money oh but i need to think haven't really think about it i also excited to host my first house party eh i very excited excitement excited that one that nice already like people to your house then you are like wah look at people's house ya that space to yourself to be able to like people over and i don't know create memories in that house good vibes good vibes ya but it's nice to have friends over that true when am i invite just saying when your house you just move in you still got all the cupboard work so take some time give me some time oh yeah correct sorry you have been busy ya so i think like a lot of people definitely would want to get some advice if they can you know on the whole process of being a first time house owner so what's the most important advice that will actually give to people who are looking to get the first place i think being a first time home owner can be quite daunting to a lot of people and sometimes in the process of getting the house you might feel like you know you never get what you want what's more important is that as long as you learn how to manage the good to have versus the must have right you will still eventually a nice place lah a place that you can call your own yeah actually the ideal home that you have in your head is really just a concept right at the end of the day yeah it's like if you fulfill your muscles then i think it's good enough yeah i be a starter home yeah is just a base for the whole house party i i just want to add on also like everyone have different opinions about like what an ideal home is right like for example we have three isies and one wedding right then every time i kena this like my house is like why the west sound very good meh the location then at the end of the day like i'll be like uh no i i i like my current home like it is the i it is like a pretty good location for me and like there are a lot of like good things that come along with it then i'll be just like mm i'm happy alone you all can say whatever you all want i'll leave that to five years later you all make your own decision from there i'm quite convinced lah i'm very curious about the west we all go there yeah i won't dis the west won't disappoint at all i hope it has been great like listening to the experience of like different types of home owners ya if you have any questions you can leave it in the comment section and i hope you enjoy this episode thank you thank you bye
