i don't know how to display our own signs of a question maybe we take out a textbook maybe in your places hi am hubby i'm i'mry a li yan this is so today's episode of chit chats we will be talking about boys' school cher okay before we start please tell us which school you guys are from okay so i was from uh ffles institution from sec one to sec four so that was my my ball boy all balls but it was my boy's school i was from at my girl's primary school who now known as saint joseph's junior then after that i went down to normal ex jack i went to saint stephen's for primary school and then i went to uh saint feb otherwise known as sain patrick school four six uh four years in secondary school yeah no problem i i'm not from a boys school but i was from c h i j talking about the experiences that you guys had uh going to a boys school uh happy maybe you can start off with you you know why because you came from uh co first and then you went into a boys school so how was that like for you okay for me like it was quite a game changer because back in my school i was i'll still very shy i remember some girls like used to bully me last time ah ya legit so i was eating food and then they took my fork then i ran away i just eat so when i went to secondary school it was all boys then like i didn't have girls to like disturb me or like bully me okay raffles like to be honest when you think of it like you will think like wah you just be like a bunch of mos or like people who just gonna study but ya like the friends that i mix with were quite rowdy lah then like ya maybe that's why i'm like this now but but it was an interesting change are you done is it similar experience like the school very like the boys school very rowdy one because this is what i think uh we will get us to a lot of nonsense lah like you know like play prank on teacher each other uh we fight uh like you go through like the high and loan altogether ya uh so i don't know if it's like a thing for mixed schools where there are girls but as in for all boys' school we used to get like public caning everyday like not everybody lah like those that means one by one do you all have any cases of like bullying in school i was a bullied ya okay lah i i didn't consider bullying essentially it was just my group of friends didn't bully anyone i don't know i think it's a big group thing i just like think this guy looks funny or something then i tell my friends guys you know this guy his his specs right his degree 1000 degree look like ah then everybody will rush to this person's class right it's bullying okay lah but i understand what you're trying making fun that kind of thing but then it is bullying lah yeah i think at that time when we were all all these ya we like didn't know better lor mm ya i think for me and my girlfriends is very similar to what game is just oh okay okay so it's just the dynamics of group los and something funny happens or when someone says something funny then we were just like attack the person guy and the person can still be one of our friends still very normal to fight in in my school mine is like everyday there was a fight so the most air one right and this was like a police case oh my god there was this two friend so they were having a conversation during recess and then his friend apparently said that his when uh it's very ugly so he got very angry and well dark that he took his fault and he sorry yes yes yes so he became known as like the popeber the friend go ya then the friend went hospital right apparently they had like four dots so like word spread naturally then our principal told us doing uh like the assembly said uh if there are news reporters outside the school please don't talk to anybody but everyone spoke to the port oh my god do you all have like um crushes on the female teacher definitely yeah very normal for me okay especially because from all by school right mm there are no females around except the teachers because i see these teachers all the time and end they carry themselves in the that makes me a little bit more attractive is this like like that in other girls crushes i wouldn't say like a serious oh my god man ma'am sia want to call a teacher ma'am ya there was a guy i know you know how teachers when they talk then they will walk down the rove then he put his elbow at the corner of the desk then when her butt like graced his elbow right then he then he hit puberties then he like uh sorry then then he was like oh sorry sorry but actually he was like did it intentionally i say it'sual harassment eh if you talk about so there was one time there was this uh release teacher the class she had to relief was a very rowdy class and basically like they took off their shirt and they started doing this oh my god i'll be terrified i don't know if like sexual harassment or what jia is i think like especially now if it's 19 context right is that aiya ten years ago it was fas as yourassment decency not that it was overlooked ya worse i guess it isn't the round overlooked so um is there any like ranking between like the boys school but do you all have a particular perceived notion of any other school do you like this school you don't like this school that kind of thing i think for me ah for for r boys ah because like i think our top rivals will be catholic get high boys okay because firstly we are within the same vicinity every time when we see cat high boy or what i don't know how we display like our own sign of a question maybe we take out a textbook read in their faces or ya but it's like when something about voice ah i think also because like they they don't have long pants and once we reach sec three then it' something that we always like internally like disturb them about lah eh wah so already still wear wear your kind of thing ya but it's all just like mindless banter among of ourselves sometimes when i see arrivos i think wah these people just take our uniform but then put our ra bad oh my god oh i think for tyets right like we honestly did not two shits about the academic ranking lah but for some reason i don't know why we always ya like we always felt like sgi was like the the nerd uncool version of secondary yeah eventually we i'll go there lah because after all we are like brothers school you mentioned a bit about like what the sanex boys to go to don't know where to see the t c girls what what was that you said you're supposed to basically of the everyday right there were a few like hot spots where san f boys will go to to like look at uh sac girls or like case girls okay ya so we always go to like ci max orine parade or like uh the marine parade the market area sgi the nearest school to us like literally like pri 500 metres down is uh scs what i've heard is that all some of the the younger boys used to walk over to scds any but i think the scgs costs didn't give a damn about us most of the time if i'm not wrong it will be the s c g s the girl with the asianguy got is it the r g s girls or not okay funny as it is uh the hot spot for me for my friends ah at least was bishan library like i think they got quite close to a group of r g s girls and crescent or cedar girls also ya so what they would do is have study sessions lah after school we move on to maybe talking about like some consessions or assumptions people have about boys school boys ya and then actually one of them uh was because i we did the episode on the girl's school culture right and then everybody's like oh all girls school girls are experienced that kind of thing is it the opposite for guys they people have something that all of you all gave i think there's definitely like um in sapes lah but we always used to make fun of sgi being like the gayar school i don't know why maybe because of the stuff that we do together when we would strip someone down to his underwear in class right right after the class a and then just leave him inside your lock the door no about our friends okay maybe that's why people quality lah we know we are not i think maybe it stems from like how close we are as like bros ya ya so like we stay over each other's house like each other one of the things that uh someone ask me to ask is that uh boys school boys bo p all these type of comments i think in saint pa it's really quite jialat there was this guy who posted on his blog he went on a date with a guy from another school that was like a saturday or something where he posted then after that weekend he came back on the monday right everyone just started like shouting at him like eh gaye gay then like people will throw tissue like people will throw like things at him then he just walked down the corridor but he wasn't like affected we knew who was kid but we didn't n't nobody bullyed them one of the guys ask me to ask you all do you all play soccer every recess won't say every recess lah there are days where we have to really eat lah cause hungry right i wasn't one of the soccer league ya another misconception right is that uh boys school boys are very rich my perception is that like all boys school for example like acs or saint andrew's are rich ones okay ya then the no lah i think for ri maybe because like is the branding knows what you that the image of an r i boy that that they portray or they like to push out is someone who is very pre very proper so like might come across as uh coming from a rich family background lah even though like there are people who are very rich and stuff but i think at the end of the day like they didn't really like use this to look down on other people i don't know why people say that because i don't know if about about now but back then there was this programme called uh something about welfare is for the the more underprivileged kids lah um no doubt i have to say that some of us come from a and above average household even in school right they teach us to be independence of our parents especially in terms of like finances so as much as i came from a from an above every household right i was actually some some poor dog i was living like day to day on the sol and mother give me maybe because we are in independent school the more wealthier parents yeah i'm more willing to spend a little bit more money and their child can do i guess all girls all all all boys school people i still my school boys are like very more elite i think it will be a lot from like the rss also like because ri is also a very elite school i think at the end of the day it really boils down to who you as a person like regardless of what school you come from and also like the kind of friends you mix with for me i i couldn't really experience any of these like uh pretentious nel elitist mindset all the perceptions right are created by our parents generation then they just like yeah pass down so that's what you think looking back at your younger self you have any advice for yourself or uh advice from people who are currently in a boys school don't take out your clothes kind of h my god i think for boys' school at least like sometimes you might get too carried away in terms of having too much fun with your friends ya but i think you still have to take note like how important like academics actually is also not something that you can just like throw away lah but instead use your dynamics bros group to encourage each other or push each other then and that's great lah because really the influence that we have on one another i would say the candy for maybe an hour just shit ah because this is how boys' school boys bond if i have kids in the future right i would still send them to like have pets or if it's a daughter i'll send them to ij lah mm ya cause i think the culture is very unique i think it's it's good to take away also lah that you know no matter what's going you go to it's like you need to work it's like you just work hard and like you know be yourself make good friends and that's great don't discriminate based on the school okay so we let's say we concluded this ep talking about boy school culture and if you guys are from boys' school and you feel like you want to add
