she was like afiqah do you want to see a surprise then she did this for skirt and then she say look underneath i look it was a mecle down there it was just blood all the way hi hi do you have any period horror stories there's so many even begin to tell you how many there are the story i'm about to tell you has the title the title is to men not have dustbins in their toilets it all started when i was hanging out with this guy at his house so we were just playing video games and stuff nothing nothing suspicious okay we were just playing video games after a while i went to the toilet lah just to do normal toilet stuff then i realise oh need to change my pad so i just you know i started changing my pet you know how girls like the pet they will take the pet and then they will like wrap it in toilet paper then they will throw it away so i had my little hat in toilet paper ball just i was holding it then i looked around and then i was like there's no bin here there's no dustbin anywhere in sight in my head i was like this guy has a surround some gaming system he has a walk in wardrobe but he doesn't have a dustbin in his toilet and then he's like outside inside and i'm like i don't want to tell him that i have nowhere to throw my pair so i really sat in there for ten minutes trying to figure out what to do and then eventually somehow somewhere i got a plastic bag and then i start it in my plastic ba how i tie up then i like shout in my pocket then i was like i i came out of the toilet and i was like i need to go home now then he was like walk then i was like buy then i myself out of this if you are a male viewer you are watching this video and you are male can you tell me do you have a du in the toilet like i'm perplexed i was staying over at my current fiance's place so at that time he was my boyfriend and i stained his bed his mum is the one that does the laundry like he will change it he knows how to change it but the laundry is all her because you know like old people they have their own way of doing laundry right so bopian have to go through her my now mother in law she changed my bedsheet with my blood but she didn't judge me or teachers like oh okay then she just like changed so like she was really really nice about it i wanted to die tldr i stained my boyfriend's bed i was so traumatised by it i can even remember the exact date it was new date first of january we were sleeping and then i woke up because i felt like my down there wet and then i was like shit did i wet the bed then i look like blood lah plus right it wasn't like a small red dot it was then my boyfriend's house the sink is outside the toilet not in the toilet so i cannot close the door so i was in the kitchen openly scrubbing my blood stain bed sheet and then his mum walk out of her room she open the door then she very happily tell me good morning come in good morning auntie what happened then i like exerbde lah oh my god she never scold me she just take over the shit and then put into the washing machine and then help me clean the bed with me because the blood actually sit through the bed sheet and then stain the mattress also so we actually flip the mattress around it's still there but if i flipping back i will see that brown patch i was gonna go on a trip and overseas trip with my classmates that like p five overseas trip lah and it was to nan sing china and it was my first time away from my parents alone together with my friends then um on the day itself when i got on the school bus i fell asleep and the next thing i knew one part of singapore all the way to changi airport my whole pants right when i woke up right towards a blood bar it was just red and i was like oh my god then i realised oh shit it's my period when i stood up right i saw so bad because like got the blood stain on the on the bus seat it's not the leather kind you know where you can just use wet tissue to wipe it's the cushion kind you know where it was soak up then i think i tried to take like some tissues or what not i really tried to wipe whatever i could oh my god this is like a blood bath eh it was so disgusting it was like one of my heaviest periods i don't know why for p five girl i like i was like eleven eh why why why they so much blood come on me i took the day then i spray i spray water or like i took some wet tissue lah i really go and spray then i go and my jeans out at the toilet bowl to make sure like everything was dry obvious i cannot walk out of the cubicle like hu naked right so i think i walk back my jeans and then you know the the the the hand dryer i just stood under there and then i just keep putting my hand there right so that it knows that mum can they can censor my hand then i stand there and let my jeans dry lor my butt like like that then roof the hair dryress dry my g and then i went back to meet my classmates as in nothing happened i don't have any specific period horror stories but every time i sneeze during my period it's just like a mygraph falls just the latest period i had somebody made me laugh damn hard and i was like in secondary school my school uniform was all white which is a recipe for a disaster especially when you're a girl going through puberty and then you don't know how to handle yourself it was a beautiful um assembly morning i did not wear a pet that was like long enough to cover my ass you know that kind of pet right it's like i think when you are younger you always try to wear that kind of pet cause you know you active or like you sit down that kind of thing then you leak at the back right one day i just didn't wear that kind of pet i stood up it was like the japan flag wah i tell you if you have white colour skirts i think you will understand the pain for 10 years of my life right my school uniform was like completely white and last time right i remember my mother used to say like wah white uniform damn troublesome very very easy stage and you know what that's exactly what happened it was a saturday some more that day just happened right we had to go back to school for some school anniversary celebration or something so can you imagine right the whole freaking school is in the auditorum and then there was a point in time where like i think the guest of honour or some like important person walk into the building then everyone need to stand to clap right the moment i stand i wait from the back she turned to me then she oh my god your skirt got stained i like no lah no lah i think you trolling me lah no lah no lah then she no no i'm damn serious then i'm like the worst part is in front of the few rows of people that were behind me right i still need to like run to the nearest toilet which is freaking far by the way and then i had to like explain to my teachers like cause some important person talking in front then you imagine like this child like trying to run out from the back she's like can you like sit down just like let the person's officer as in no no no no no you don't understand i got sc now i got sick secret right now then i ran out i mean at that point in time it's not possible to hide it from anybody but also like you're 13 and like nobody really cares so when i remember i need to go to toilet and then it was quite packed so there's only like one cubicle left then when i went in i was like why does it smell so funny so i look over the bean was with hair and then you can see right some pad is not even wrapped with the tissue paper you know but you can see the red squad and the black stuff ya lah then it was damn closes lah it's like stack and you cannot close and on top of that right still got one paper you know and is soak when i talk about it i still remember the smell of the paper but a horror story i would say is uh when i was in the toilet um changing my pet so there are like period panties where like the material is a bit like silicon beish because of that material is very loud when you remove the pet so like i could hear like my seniors outside laughing at me when i was changing my pets wah this girl change your pet damn loud ah the whole world also no so i felt very embarrassed at that point of time to be called out in the sense for changing my pet so loudly so i think i waited in the toilet for like about 10 minutes and i was very cautious when i left cause i wanted to make sure that they went back all the way to their classroom before i even leave the toilet just in case you know like i don't know maybe they wait for me outside to see who is this girl changing a pad so loudly i can't control the sound i'm just changing my pad and like you also manarin right like i've been in a girls school for 10 years so that means all things periods are super normalised sometimes when across the room as anybody got uh pet they will just tos across and it's totally normal so in sec three we were having assembly and we were in the hall and i was sat beside this girl and she was known to be very rebellious and she will always be like no to fight you want to fight ah and i was i was kinda scared of her but she was friendly to me and i and i wanted it to stay that way it was really boring assembly and she tap on my back she was like afiqah do you want to see a surprise first of all this assume is really boring i would love to see a surprise second of all i don't want to pissed off so i just said yes sure then she did this for a skirt and then she say look underneath and i was just so bored and brain dead from the assembly i just okay i look it was a melaka down there it was just blood all the way it's not like she leaked to anything she was free bleeding free bleeding from her young heart spente we were cross like sittingcris cross right and then she just dragged her butt on the floor and she left a bloody snail trail on the ground and i did not know how to react i was just staring at the trail i just didn't know what to say i felt like if i saidÂ what are you doing gonna beat me up if i pointed it out i would embarrass her so i did not know what to say i just like great girls school things thank you for watching this episode let us know in the comments what else you like
