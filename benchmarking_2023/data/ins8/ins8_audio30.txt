it came as kind of a blind side for me because i was let go from my job at midnight of the singapore time i was logged out of everything already yeah on that day itself that day i talk about today we are going to talk about workplace rejection sekali this episode one of us will get rejected to the end of the episode to see who get fired just kidding how do you all deal with rejections what are youressing me and my question my first experience in rejection i i will always remember i was sixteen sixteen and i plucked out of my courage to call this guy to ask him out for prom oh and he said no not like i think i'm the best person out there but yeah it was like a yeah i thought we were pretty good friends but you to say yet yeah if you're out there watching like this person yeah you said no to wey hello hello so i don't necessarily feel a lot from my work rejection but for the 2022 one um it was it came as kind of a blind side for me because i was let go from my job and i'm just like i have a zoom call schedule and then like i enter a zoom call like okay cool what's this about and then itâ€™s like so you have uh fifteen days left um and uh your fifteen days notice starts now and you are just not a right fit for the company and we felt that it's better this way and you don't have to work the next fifteen days your work stops today you just straight away that day yeah us i say so why um like you know is there something i can do was just something i wasn't doing all he said was just you're not a right fit for the company like am i such a bad person like that you have to cut me off now and it's not even like work the next notice you know it's like now and gone you're gone i was super sad that night when it happened because at midnight of singapore time i was logged out of everything already yeah on the day itself yeah the day so i was like during my mind i was like what i do i'll send you did i like why is it so like card yeah i cut through and cold yeah anyway so i felt super sad that day because i think i was like wondering like okay so am i just not cut out to do this kind of work yeah um i mean okay background and context is uh program manager program and ya i also came to it yesterday project managing but but this is the more cream but it's then i wasn't um so well versed in my content creating videos and all that so then it's like i've no experience there yeah it's kind of like your security is just gone then would you say they're right when they say you're not a good fit there so after that yes i mean like thinking about it yeah i do feel like it if i would have pushed to stay then yes lah it will just be me trying to like putting up a friend yeah to work yeah yeah in a place where i don't feel the most passionate in right so in that sense that work rejection it was something good because it let you to find a place that you will feel passionate for i i mean after that i talk to a friend and then um after talking to that friend i kind of uh okay he okay that friend is now my partner but anyway at night just saying like okay um cause i have a faith right so man's rejection is god's direction so kind of like you may feel like you are rejected in this one area and like you feel like all is lost but it might actually be a opening to another place that you can go and like a different direction and can go to sometime we might be forced to find that silver lining ourselves in order to make the process much more purposeful and enjoyable like for example i always wanted to be a nurse cannot tell right yeah yeah i always want to be a nurse so i applied for nursing so many times and i got rejected so many times i even get so many people to help me write recommendation letter you know like singapore record director form teacher everyone i know to write saying that i would make a goodness i even went to see the m yeah they just say no like no reasoning oh they didn't they didn't even give any reason it's just straight up a on the computer in a way i think it's is there's a silver lining because uh through the years after the rejection and everything it allowed me to find passion n other areas that i never thought i had like community services it's because i didn't get into nursing that's why i got myself involved in so many volunteering work so the desire to help people is still there yeah the desire to help people is still there and i'm like oh actually i can help people through this way too not too bad i'm glad i didn't get accepted because if i did right i don't think i'll be sitting here i don't think i'll be sleeping here ranting about why i cannot go into that ah guess cause i i didn't really face like huge huge work rejection or career rejections because like i was on a a scholarship so it really dictated the past that i was going to take like i was going to be in moe for minimum four years because of the contract so when i left that job and then travel and then came back to do a make career change i realised that i've never written a cv before and i didn't even have a linkedin page because as a teacher you don't need linkedin and sometimes i feel like rejections help you to grow you know help you to put yourself out there more and have that confidence because you faced that rejection yes and so it was very very scary for me and i was just like ya i wrote a quite a convincing cover letter starting with age is just a number but like anyone respond i mean o c s did lah can you see it work would you know what would have happened to you if you were if your scholarship was rejected oh um no i mean i wanted to have like a nice answer to it but i was like no lah confirm can get a based on results it was really like i think i can get it and if i don't get it then um find other scholarship my mum told me like i need to um fund my own university education so that was already told to me like when i was in jc so like i cannot have um i cannot afford to fail yeah but not to say i don't face rejection lah on a daily basis because of what we do as video journalists we need to find profiles we need to pitch our ideas to our bosses like it's a daily thing profiles are gonna say no and then there's no silver lining it's just no i have no other option like find another story find another um profile and you know one like that's your best profile that rejected you but you have no choice but to just deal with it mm so i think in cases when there's no server lining then you just need to accept and move on lor yeah i mean like you rightly said the takes are different for everybody yeah but i think one thing that was said to me that like really helps in a dealing with rejection and i'm moving on with it it's like the worst thing that can happen is they say no it's true and then the best thing that can is to get something out of it so i think when we're talking about this is it still feels quite light millennial yeah we don't have to raise our kids or anything whereas for people if they have a family and then they face rejection right the ts are a lot bigger yeah yeah we definitely do have more options lah given the kind of circumstances that we're in like it's really a self privilege i think in life you always have a lot of um you always go through a lot of nose and i don't deny you i will still feel sad yeah like if i don't continue os i still feel fair yeah for sure for us in os a lot to come to you i don't need to experience another come part too yeah but i think it's just a perspective switch for me lah at least personally in my own life in my mind i turn around and it's like no not you know thank you to me but it's like no i want to thank you for saying that no no okay hi bella this is an adslot from n please present as if you're
