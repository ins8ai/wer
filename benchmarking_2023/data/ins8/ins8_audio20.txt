i find it quite therapeutic to clean dishes you have no cares in the word hokkien we say lup sup their lup sup so ah like you eat dirty you grew up dirty sometimes i ask what am i doing with my life when i first started get a fishwasher it's a real struggle i was very scared of the dirt and the film mana senior ah okay thank you bang see the grind and the rotting food sometimes because of the smell it will make you like a gag feeding is the bread and butter of my family my mum she actually has been in this line for quite a while now couple of decades in fact i really respect her a lot because she is a no breadwinner she brought me and my sister up handedly i was faced with the decision on whether i should go to uni or come to this dish washing line to help my mum i realise that maybe you don't need a degree to wash dishes yeah i don't think she can keep going at this pace much longer so ya i guessed to step in to help evate this burden of her thank you my colleagues are all very old yeah they're like my ah ma's age very wholesome i feel sometimes it's like i'm working with my ah ma like that technically like right but they would actually buy me meal sometimes it's like they see me as their own bra i feel like people can't respect you if you don't know how to do it if you want to manage something you have to learn the nature of it and the best way is by doing it and if they had anything that he's struggling with or uh things that could be improved terms of processes ya i wanted to make that change it was also tough sometimes when i bump into people that i actually know then they will see like oh like how bad did he mess up his life feeling like washing dishes or like during the trash if i were to say like oh yeah this is my mum's company uh i'm working i feel that it's very snobbish his credit all the hardwork that i put in being a servant doesn't mean that you're the lowest yeah in fact is a joy growing up without dad made me insecure but it was in church that i found my confidence so i think growing up like that it they also stuck with me that yeah i can find joy in serving people i started to turn like my coping mechanism with humour so if people like ask me boy ni zhe yang nian qian wei ni yao jiang i'll tell them oh xian zai tan qing bu hao hai the ta whatever put food on the table keep ripping just yet this is really an honest living and you serving the society that you're doing something that there are not many people wants to do this happens that for me it's cleaning and might not be the most glamorous but ya it's still a form of serving they're always just in the background they are the you everyday life running so i just hope that next time anyone he's a younger person it's not because they mess up their lives it is still a honest job
