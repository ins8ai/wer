my friends and i were having a couple of drinks and my friend just said what kind of truffle do you use i said i use japanese soap he said bro burning very pretentious i think that was the best name we got so we just stuck with it hi my name is jeremy i'm the owner of baril and i will be operating about four to five years now burning out we are uh dombui place which is rice and made on top so what we really specialise in is chargow meat we use only japanese charcoal and wood charcoal to grill all our items we are selling quite a lot of upscale things in such an environment we actually started with skewers then now we have only one skiwrel which is our strawri skewer lah the idea was conceived when i was walking in the streets of japan with my parents we saw this place owned by a japanese and he knew it yes he knew exactly what they wanted when they came in and i wanted to create something similar here when we first started it was challenging a lot of people were very skeptical about this place waste of my money we prepared to close ah with service kind of things i think a lot of motivation comes intrinsically where we see that we can produce results that nobody thought that we could take what you think is constructive from this hating and apply effectively to yourself mm ultimately it's a hidden gem to them ya it's like a surprise finds such an area the charcoal itself when it burns it burns at a higher temperature so everything is nicely set and the smoky flavour is different a lot of people say these are taste of earlier times i found out that i liked cooking when i was fourteen it was difficult to come out as someone that wants to pursue this my parents and i explored the option of going to a culinary programme for me it was i was pretty certain that i was going to follow this pass all the way i guess i knew what i wanted to do since i was fourteen in every hawker there's a story and it's just so happens that i'm younger young people should pave the way for other younger people to let them see that actually it's doable i encourage more young people to explore the option of being a hawker to push boundaries of what a new age hawker centre could be because there's a lot emphasis on younger generations being a food entrepreneur i want to be a farmer like for real for real for someone that really likes to cook i think it's important for me to get in touch with the produce the livestock the whole chain that i'm not currently exposed to it gives a deeper sense of appreciation of people who are actually doing this and learn to treasure the ingredients more i think really that's the ultimate goal you know just to you know some chickens big some pigs have some cows i rather than us mm okay
