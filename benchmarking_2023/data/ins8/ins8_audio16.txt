so every time after smoking i will always be very happy with then i will text my friend i really smoke until high then they will smoke smoke not wet don't worry i mean i smoke the meat until i really very high very happy now okay hello i'm jay and i want a few female sea masters in singapore and i smoke meat i was struggling and debating with myself if i call myself smoker but i don't smoke so that's the only term that i conclude myself as a pit master somebody who knows the equipment well there was once when i was smoking at home the meat where i took it out right then it was so soft that it sleeped and fell off my hand and flatter on the ground half of it went into my free sorn i smoke about 80 to 90 kilos of biscuits a week whiscuit is actually a very tough cut of meat in the smoking circle right it's kind of like the ultimate goal that everybody wants to reach smoking is usually dominated by nails i have to carry 90 kilo of meds every week i think it's easier for males with their strength and physical bill but i'm somebody who enjoy doing such things and i feel that women can also do the things that men can do i don't really have to go gym anymore already i think so so when i first started it was at the backyard of my house within six months i scaleed up into a commercial business i had like some strangers coming up to me and say that you know you are not a fnb train you're not a chef like what makes you think that you can sell your meat it's also this kind of words that make me motivate and go on further like i want to prove him wrong i also want to prove myself wrong so i will convert my energy into how i can smoke better meats when i first stumbled upon smoking meats like online reading up people who don't sleep for 20 over hours i was like siao of these people it was really crazy eh who looks like now i'm part of it so right now it has been 22 hours and the riscuit is finally i think should be ready with a lot of time and patience and love so that when you look at the end result that's the part that it will wow out yourself when you make everybody around you like wow and i think that is like the joy of um smoking and i really i really enjoy myself when i first listed my product on my website and then it was totally sold out in 30 seconds i realised that you know when you set your mind onto something you can just work through it i believe that the passion the love you have the enjoyment that you have it will always be reflected in the mood and for me that your heart just feel so full i think that is really the the kind of feeling that i'm looking for and whatever that i do i mean not just smoking yeah life is short i just enjoy so you must share the happiness joy with everybody just like how i share my food
