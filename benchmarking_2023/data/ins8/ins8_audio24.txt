one of the hard things that i had to do was i had no idea how to change the diaper i had to learn that all by myself at that point of time i was just focused on how do i keep this baby alive hello hello hi i'm with you vanessa and i'm ali i need you you like how old are you this year i'm twenty two o so i'm you one year younger you're twenty one yeah twenty one this year so like how old were you when you found out that you were pregnant i was seventeen years old when i found out i was pregnant i was still in school seventeen so you were in funny ya do you still remember the moment when you found out yes i remember i was in my roommate um bathroom uh i was uh already living a alone by the time i found out i was pregnant um and then i took the test and i called her in and i was just telling her like and then we just look at it at the same time and we were just freaking out how did you tell your parents that you were expecting um so i did that first with my stepfather and he broke down crying he actually blamed himself he said that if he stayed for the family or like if he had been a better father and i just i don't know how to feel cause i've never seen him vulnerable this is like an asian dad crying and you know just like a a rare side and even though we're not blood related he's always out there looking for me all the time so when i broke the news to my mum that was ugly that was the but i mean my biological parents literally talk about stoning someone you know like the old religious text about stoning someone to death and they were like thinking about oh um you're living insane and they were forcing me to marry this guy and um at that point of time i knew this guy was abusive and i knew for a fact that this marriage will never work out but i went along anyway because um it got really ugly to a point where um they threatened my stepfathers like work his job and i didn't want him to suffer i got married at seventeen even though i was married um i was basically a single mum cause i was doing things on my own financially i was the main caregiver for my daughter as well so everything was just on me how did you manage to find the courage to leave your toxic marriage i've always had that once and it was just more of like the right time and i wasn't twenty one back then so a lot of the laws were not on my side especially it's like um i couldn't rent a place i would have to live in a shelter if if i didn't get married and all that so the minute that i have turned twenty one i just did i i filed for divorce then there's no looking back has the thought of abortion ever like crossed your mind when i found out it was positive it ner i was like i wanted her and i i mean i've also had friends who choose the other option and i don't judge them for it you know it's like whatever works best for your life but for me it's that at that point of time i was going through so much things and i thought like life wasn't was you know worth it yet so when i i had when i saw that line i was just i had something else to live for how was the nine months like like from the day you found out all the way the whole nine months was not easy i still continued school so i went to school pregnant i remember they had to like actually um put me in a separate room cause i was already due for birth and i still had to take exams oh my god so ya i went to school with my bigest valley and then like was working six strop so freelance and then i also did like a telecom and i was taking up a lot of odd jobs basically just to kind of like make ends meet the whole motivating like factor for it was like i want my daughter to be proud of me like oh my god that's my mum my mum did that i did yeah and if i can do that she can do better you know that kind of thing i want i want my daughter to be able to feel like that what was the hardest part about being a mum at seventeen like when you were so young at that point of time i was just focused on how do i keep this baby alive like i check on her every single hour and i was just you know i feel like i suck i'm failing all the time like sleepless nights regardless whether i was feeding her or not because even when i'm not feeding her i'm like checking on her like you're still breathing and maybe that's like mom anxiety or something like a new mom's anxiety i wasn't really focused on my tiredness i was just trying to be a mum for me like i was raised by a single parent as well and grow up seeing my mother raised all of us by herself it was already a lot for someone who was in her mid forties i cannot imagine what it's like for someone in their late team um i don't know how i dealt with it because at seventeen all i did was i kept myself busy and that's actually that if you kind of look at it because i didn't give myself space to feel i did eventually feel burnt out after that and it was kind of ugly and i do remember asking my mum's the same thing and she was also like i don't know how i didn't ya and i think as mums is like when you have a baby um you just have this sense of courage i mean not all mums are perfect i understand that but it's like they do everything baby i have a rush of feelings right now i i don't want because kind of saw all of this in real time happened um when i was about nine years old i actually saw my mum have a stroke and it was from all the stress of managing like my fam like my family together how were you able to i think eventually make room for love for yourself so when ah you say mad room for love it's always about loving yourself and then when your daughter sees that in you she'll do it for herself there was one time i had this conversation with my uh best friend um i was worried that you know why she grows up and she end up she ends up like me and um she said why is that a bad thing i don't really know how to like answer this because if i were to say like oh i don't want her to end up like me it's like shaming my myself as well for me it's like i always tell myself that my love is bigger than my fears and that's where you find courage and and that's how your daughter is gonna have also so i mean i understand you're also a single mum and you're doing everything on your own do you wish like you had more help like someone to like let you have a break uh i do have like the thing but then like when you take a break then you will think about your child so in the end like i had to go back with my child mm so mum guilt yeah kind of mum guilt you know i get what you mean yeah but i mean personally it's like i've been through the whole mum guilt thing you should like don't care about my table because i i mean i know it's really hard you need to put yourself first because it's like you go crazy and you don't want to lose yourself while you're taking care of your kids right then what do you do to make you happy what i do ah um cook bake ya i love to cook yes i love to cook yes what was your car like dreams and aspirations before you became a mum um f and b i was actually working under f and b oh okay ya so i love like in that sector you know get to meet people you get to cook maybe one day um make it as a f and b like home business ya then like another thing will be like maybe social work social work okay not have not crazy in your life like that's the last thing ever after i became a mum i was like no i do feel like also the stereotype of single teen mum i feel like people tend to categorise these sort of people as very very promiscuous very careless have you ever had this sort of encounters before oh all the time i'm telling you like when i was single i had guys telling me like oh you're just good to you're just yes ya it's just good for a for a for a night they were like saying oh you're you're at the bottom of the uh of the chain you're listening a single the malay mum um and you're like saying no one's gonna ever marry you but you know it's like everyone has a different starting line and single mums might be at the back cause everyone else is like at the at the front and it's not a race just a journey so i really don't care about what they want to say about whether curious or not it's like as long as i continue to improve myself i continue to help the people around me and the people who are also has gone through the same thing as me i did my part what's your daughter's name uh my daughter's name familiar ya she's four years old mm so like was she what got you through like the toughest days like even up till now can i be honest yeah i mean i love my baby but sometimes they are the reason for your tougher days but but yeah the thing that got me through is like i would this may sound like so self absorbed by me it's like youise your mental health take a break and then you're back ya so it's like she is my main motivation and drive but like day to day when it gets hard it's like you need time to kind of relax and take your mind off and like have alone time ya i mean after everything that you went through with like amelia do you still want more kids i eventually did fine love i met my husband now he is like he has to be the best of the best cause um i really i'm traumatised so my expectation is always there um he exceeded all of it and he's like shrek he was right yeah like i love track okay yeah yeah oh my god like okay he's grumpy as well but he's really like came to the right person i don't don't know like looks like looks like wait why he looks like shao know looks like he's a band but like your personality is right okay and yeah he's been very supportive you i was emotional and he was always trying to be present in there for me all the time yeah and he's not afraid to change diapers i mean i know again the minimum but he's really putting himself out there he's really like putting in a lot a lot of effort ya so uh i have another son now four months old uh he's with michael and amelia has um been a very protective sister like literally would smack you if you take her brother away so cute uh i don't know about a cute part but yeah she will like literally look at you up to up down just to ya like are you worthy of my brother yeah it's very perspective like that was there any difficulty in introducing her to like the your new um partner at the beginning um usually she don't like people but when i first like introduce my then boyfriend to her now husband um she immediately warmed up when she was around him she was just i know she feels very safe to just be herself i mean it was her on her own initiative to call her papa ya after we started dating a few months currently my dad is trying to talk to me he's not been in my life for about fifteen years so you know he'll occasionally send me messages asking me how i am but i normally ignore them um would you want your daughter to maintain a relationship with her birth father um that for now when she's too young to make a decision for herself i would step in and not now definitely i do not want her to maintain a relationship with her until she's old enough and i'm confident that she can make good decisions on her own if the father still wants to kind of have that relationship with her he's got to learn how to love that girl because you left that little girl so now you have to wait until she's old enough for her to be able to stand up on her own and make her own choices again it's my daughter's choice i i wouldn't want to impose that on her but at at least for this age it's like i need to make the right choices for her oh what's your daughter's name wasabelle a nice name like a princess name i even gave the meow name like jay oh oh she's precious as a jerry so cute ya best best part being to get home being with her her growth just yesterday um like the teacher just called me up for parent teacher meeting and she was like telling me you know it was a well she's very loving and carrying her friend fall down she just hugged so it's like i felt very very happy with her yeah yeah do you feel the most happiest when you reach your kids yes most of the time it's like um it's happy and then stress and then happy i mean the best thing i really love to do with her i just listening to her talk and i just love to see how a tiny brain is works you know it's just like the different phases of of their growth it's just like every part of it is great it's like they grow up so fast it's like one month later you have a whole new different kids and you just have to fall in love with that kid all over again so i'm just enjoying every version of them that they're becoming for now are you happy now definitely i mean i've been through hell and back and i've always been happy it was just like how you look at it i guess i find happiness within myself and i hope my kids will do that for themselves as well hell that's why she's so cute let's say you oh my god so cute it's the cutter's age ever wow hey guys thanks so much for watching this
