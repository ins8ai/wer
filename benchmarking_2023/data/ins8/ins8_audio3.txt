when i was at my peak i spent most whatever i earn he got nice schooling i own couple of lutery watches the lowest point of my life i was homeless and i i never tell anyone you know because i was very embarrassed i stay in east coast for a couple of days then i go to changi but i was thinking of questioning to myself you know what can i do get my time out of this some people they are very good with maths yeah i'm not good with maths but i'm good at day dreaming that's my biggest talent dedreaming i do a lot of creative work that i like to travel yeah and i like images i shoot everything you know i go to bus stop public area i just shoot randomly island aesthetic from there i don't go to phil school but i got lucky lah yeah in a way right because i meet the right people so i met this japanese boss ah mood he set me to japanese construction in singapore at that point right i get quite good income it's hard to penetrate you know japanese construction i've never seen this kind of amount of money before financially i'm not taught how to save money my circle of friends ah didn't come for money lah so they go party they have nice cars and so on i was influenced by my surroundings i got to watches like omega rolex at one point i was feeling a good life so but uh life is not a bit of roses after eight years only pass on ah things get bad then covid started right uh everything disrupted especially the construction area i was a freelancer about a year plus ah project getting lesser and lesser so i don't have enough income i sold everything you know i don't have any camera i have just enough money to buy a tent then uh with me right uh just a small little bag remember one time i called my mum so my mak ask me eh what are you how are you i i'm good my friend play thinking maybe eh my son is doing quite good you know you're somewhere because i seldom see my mum i feel like i'm let down that point ah i was really very hungry and people next to me their barbecuing that is the saddest part of my life one day uh i feel a pain in my ear when i close my eyes i can see red blue purple so i didn't know something is happening inside my head i was warded so i was diagnosed with a stroke due to my condition it was uh very hard for me to apply for a job when i was hospitalised uh i met this uh social worker uh connected me to nowhere my first impression i thought he's a young man yeah because uh when he spoke to me ah he sounds very jovial unergetic he tell me that not to worry because he's there to guide me and help me revamp my resume it outdated roughly in terms of his personality he's a fighter he's a survivor lah so he went to do grab uh he went to take on part time jobs that comes his way so this is something that i really admire him when he shared with me his situation i was able to empathise with him and i guess that also helps him to move on because he had a listening ear and from there he can work towards getting employment most of my life i'm alone i'm on my own you know it's like i haven't send when noel caught me because at that time i was quite desperate lah you know one thing that i noticed is he has grown in terms of his confidence right and and what i see is along the way he bouncs back pastor from adversity with the help he runed a job yes so this is actually much needed for me to support myself the way i describe my life is like a roller coaster because there will be a lot of ups and a lot of downs but you have to be kind to yourself and uh acknowledge your weakness ah and have teeth so i accept my situation now i cannot get back whatever i lost in the past ya so what i can do is just look ahead and make my life better now i'm looking forward to my uh coming bto so i always wanted to have my own home lah so i'm very happy and i'm looking forward to be living in that house uh my name is rafi uh and i'm 51 years old uh and im doing my best ya in life
