i think like last year somebody dm me like hi i need to tell you something your photos are on like a similar like group kind of thing yes i said like they have any screenshots so the person said no there's no screenshots but i can sing in the link to join but it was a very suspiciously long link and then said you have to input your phone number i like why yeah welcome back to the talks and today we have not new guests like nico nols do the newa exactly but we have a new games like many welcome we talk a lot about scams today and how susceptible we are to scams have you guys fallen or have any encounter with scams before i've never really had a scam but i think maybe my closest interaction was that i i had some like credit card and debit card related fraud so basically i was overseas and then i don't know what prompted me to decide to check my credit card statement which i checked it like once every then i saw like thousand plus plus plus deducted on my credit card and then i checked my debit card and for some reason a few other thousands deducted i called them and they were like okay immediately you know cancel all your cards uh we'll like return you the money just like file your claims and whatever so yeah so scary but you got your money back i did i think the probably the scariest part was that i didn't know where it came from what was the source of like you know how they got the numbers correct correct usually you use your phone for everything nowadays right like you link your cards to your phone and then you use your phones to like buy things from shops you scan here scan there think maybe it's do that but there's really no way to verify right so right ya no i've seen like um recent posts about people who download apps and then those like apps intern track your bank movements or something like yeah so i very scared of oh my gosh i better go and look at my statement i get my sha it's i got money to eat right speaking of the scanning q thing there was this case i don't know if you all saw on the news yeah yeah basically this is like 60Â old woman she's not an ad of this c code that was scanned for free bubble tea so she scandied and she woke up in the morning i think twenty thousand dollars taken from her bank account but it's exactly what when lease it right bubble tea one night cause ya lor like the software had access to her bank account details i would have followed for that yeah i've downloaded many things of it like what so far there's been no scams but if a shop tells me just download this app or just sewing this survey for a free drink or free toppings at bubble tea store and done everything allegedly like the woman who scan the qr code for the free bubble tea even though it was at the bubble tea shop the bubble tea shop say it wasn't by them she didn't even get a free bubble tea cake auntie so apparently what i read that you can do in order to protect yourself right is that if you're downloading an app you need to make sure that you are downloading from the proper app stores which is like apple app store and google play store make sure you check that the developer details are like real and then if you had already downloaded the app what you need to do is to turn your phone to esplain mode right turn off wifi and then run an an anti scam application just to make sure everything is good you should also check whether you have any unauthorised bank transactions that has been done through another device yeah i hear now that the banks are actually rolling out this new measure to lock a certain amount that you have digitally like in a like a vault almost so it can't be digitally transferred out but if you want to like transfer money you have to probably go in person like to an atm or like a branch to like kind of like do that yourself yeah do that big transfer so like then have you ever fell for any or encounter any like phishing scams i think like last year somebody dm me like hi i need to tell you something your photos are on a similar group kind of thing yeah and obviously i was so scared even if you don't send any explicit pictures to people you don't take it in general you know what i mean i can like edit or something right there's this fear like did somebody record me in the changing room i say like they have any screenshots cause the first thing will do right yeah so the person said no there's no screenshots but i can send you the link to join then i said oh yes please i thought it will be like maybe a whatsapp group chat all this kind of things but it was a very suspiciously long linked those um with not a common domain name or so i was like okay went in and then i said you have to input your phone number i like why why isn't this just a telegram group chat why like it's not that difficult to join right yeah then i put to train i was like a bit suspicious already so i said it didn't work he said you have to put a real number i was like how do you know i didn't you know what i mean you so creepy yeah so i was like okay this is very suspicious i asked around i posted my experience for them so a lot of people came in and said like it's a scam don't fall for it this kind of thing though like how they take the weak spot and then they attack it correct i know where you're vulnerable and then they no common for these things to happen in singapore in terms of like spreading pictures around you know so girls always have that lingering fear it's so scary and to exploit it it's just very evil yeah the message itself was crafted in a very friendly and personal way like hi there's a the pictures of you play around this very important could you check your messages kind of thing so it's like okay the conversations float very personal like it was really somebody talking to me thing but nowadays i tell you like scams not only evolve with like technology but like like what you said like how they pray on people's vulnerabilities and um emotions as well to kind of like get money out of them basically someone approach this person to say that they have a job offer they are from job street and then they ask the person to give a sum of money with promised like returns you know i think heard of this y y this case actually happened to my actual friend like i have a very close friend of mine that went through this exact sounds exactly the same so it's through telegram yeah it's telegram like a conversation kind of thing she was quite skeptical initially but once she transferred right and then she saw the returns and there's this trust building basis that you go through right and once you realise that actually the money quite easy to earn ah so you would dare to invest a little more she continued to invest continued to give until one day the return didn't come back yeah so that was when it got really bad and they didn't get back to her and that was when she realised oh my god this is a scam because this is it i just got scammed because it's twenty k it boils up to twenty k is a lot of money did didn't twenty k gone or they can do and make a police report about it yeah jialat do you all feel that you will fall or something like that or we all blame yourselves if you do i say i think previously i used to think that a i know only old people fall for scam no leh i think increasingly the scam had takes right the rise i don't want to say that i will never i think there's a high possibility that it might happen i hear that there's some ways that it can prevent new job scams which is basically if a company approaches you you should do background research on the company don't pay to secure a job offer yeah i think it's a bit weird don't fall for this too good to be true true do something small and then you get a quick buck and don't give out your personal details like your phone number yeah so i think that's how you kind of at least we can just think of this yeah link yeah there's this app called scary shield the fox icon right you've used it before i have it on my phone i'll basically just installed it once and then set it up once uh it prevents scammers from calling you in the first place oh yeah that's really annoying install now i'm installing right talking about menu um just now you were saying that this uh sharing your stories online helps to normalise conversation i was watching tiktok and then i saw a video of this girl was talking about how she got scammed by this rental facebook market place rental posting so basically what happened was that she sort of posting on facebook and then she contacted the agent because she was interested in the viewing so the agent was like okay ya not available for you to come out to date but i'm not free so i get my pa to bring you so i was like okay ya sure who's went with the pa to go and see the house an actual person i an actual person oh my gosh an actual house okay she was like oh ya very nice very good price not bad she push my luck ask for like a slightly lower monthly fee then the agent very quickly yeah can can can no problem no problem no fight like no sign then she was like okay a bit sars they started to like oh yeah can quickly sign you know like if you like it today then we sign it today which is like usually doesn't really happen that way yeah you need some discussion correct and there's like a bit of like back forth what she did was that she went to ask one of her friends with a real estate agent to go and check like their real estate agent depository reporty of agent numbers to see if that agent in the end couldn't find which is like it's a scam didn't sign a yeah a day high level of speaking of shopping online they all on instagram scrolling and then this ad came out for a moon lam basically a lampship like a moon okay it's quite cute i yeah it's like so then you can change colour and all that right but i was like oh my god it looks so nice it like me so i was like oh my god i want to buy one week later i think i was checking then i was then i realised like i have no news about my lamp coming right then i went to find the i don't think it's i got a receipt or something but i remember where i bought the thing from so i went to search online like this website and it didn't exist then but did you like check for reviews no i didn't get it i just like mop i have to have it i have to have this put in my card details but how i want to count then i was like oh my god i went to check my bank account to see if there was any other transactions but i mean don't have lah versus that lam that was deducted then i was like oh damn
