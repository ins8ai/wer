the sticker uh let me thank the minister for the for to to for the clarifications as well as uh for clearing the air on this issue in fact many of us have uh received feedback from our residents that uh giving comments that every time the government increase subsidy the childcare operator will increase their fees you know it seems to be corresponding but i think i thank the minister for producing the data as well as the statistics that's too important it is still quite tough for middle income families uh which have a a few a few children in childcare especially the even with the subsidy itself they may not be they may find it tough for for for their monthly income the other group that i'm a little bit concerned with is uh for the non-working mothers i think there i understand there's already additional uh subsidy for non-working mothers if they fulfil the criteria you know my take is that currently now how many of these children are belong to who enjoy subsidies are belong to non-working matters can we equalize both groups instead of making them apply you know to this criteria if you were to put working mothers or non-working mothers aside how much more increase in term of subsidies will the government have to bear you know rather to to make the working mothers go a non-working mothers go and apply for additional subsidy i thank the member for his questions every year some preschool operators will make some adjustments to their fees there are many many operators private not for profit as well as uh moe kindergartens uh so "every year there will be some adjustments whether or not we make adjustments to our subsidies so that uh i hope that clear the misunderstanding and in fact the vast majority of households earning 12,000 and below ought to see reduction in childcare fees they of course some centres private operators that charge the thousands of dollars and fees and make adjustments in the hundreds of dollars that is quite a different uh situation altogether but for the vast vast majorityÂ " they should see fall in childcare fees from january next year as i said from january 2021 for partner operators we will bring down the fe cabs even further and thereafter the anchor operators see a fall as well uh so that is on your first question the second point is on families with many children and so apart from looking at total household income they also uh look at for families with many dependents and more children in preschool will look at it from a per capital basis so that they can get even more support on non-working mothers uh the support uh provided to them takes into account the fact that because they are working they will need a full day childcare and by working mother we talking about working two days a week and that can include the informal sector as well so there is a degree of flexibility and in fact working mother status is confirmed if her mother works for two days a week or fifty roughly fifty six hours month uh we do uh grant special approval if mothers have uh uh caregiving needs for children younger than twenty four months or if they're looking after uh other dependence uh for those who are looking for employment uh we make concessions for them and allow them to benefit from the full subsidy and for those who are non-working mothers uh what they can do is uh they can go for the basic subsidy for full full day childcare or if not and they're at home with no other uh caregiving responsibilities other for their other than their young children then there is an option to go for kindergarten with keas subsidies so that half day they get the pedagogical support the other half day time with the parents time with family family bonding time
