e e two sorry this one is my e e what you think of my sign language little bit hard to understand right later the video is out he better check out like those es scar later the de committee told me i'm wejie i'm one of the coounder for for coffee i my name s a l a h u d b i n i do service ya and prepare who drinks and cashiering as well if customers come in how you communicate with them so customer will write an point at the menu and our right p a d ipad your skin scared of you a little bit while din in death we also have jane with autism and sustra with mild intellectual disability if there's no did uh they will take a longer time to do things he's the one that would push them to do after and to meet hi oh youtube i learn the alphabets ah then other stuff is either she or pauline each what will make you feel very very angry it's more of the things in the cafe uh which they forgot how to do and then he'll just be more patient uh to teach them again repeatedly sometimes people with special needs do get anxious easily because of sudden changes in the environment or if you try to throw them in an unexpected situation so that's the thing with working with my supervisors they're very very patient people and that's why i also need to come in and tell them they have to share with me and not just keep quiet to themselves they also didn't want me to worry about it he bought me quite a few cutting skillsÂ me using a knife he's a very kind and caring person and then also very encouraging for you worried you cannot find job part to find job with them so you share with your family that you're the supervisor and then they're surprised ya what made you feel happy working here the staff the customer and with other supervisors mm they go out many times together the idea for a social enterprise came about during like my undergraduate years learning about the different marginalised communities and feeling injustice i know how i feel like too not being included in activities with friends and so and so forth so if this group of people in our society are being left out how can i then create something on a larger scale for other people to also accept them meaningfully into society we don't put up signs to say that we have people with disabilities because my staff also want to manage many customers that come along the way and i think that's part of the the job that uh we all want to do ya regardless of disabilities
