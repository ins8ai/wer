the girl was asking the father why the guy is so short the usual questions that cheats to ask out of curiosity this is what you normally hear on the street it's good that kids are ah it shows that they are observed and the observation skills are pretty pretty good uh i found out about my condition when i was about four to five i realised my classmates their brody proportions were different from me my legs and my hands were shorter my head was bigger they started to mock at me in terms of why your head is so big it did kind of really really disturb me why can't i lead a normal life does my head um affect you why why that comment why that question and stuff one of the biggest struggle i face every day not able to reach things of a certain height that a normal person can do so for example at home i will have to use a stool to reach something that is higher than need but also it trains me to find creative ways to overcome my problems people it's out of curiosity It's my parents born like that that's why i'm like that i don't blame them for asking because more than happy to share knowledge of things that they may not be fully aware of the growing stages much slower i only started to walk at the age of four i always blame my condition for affecting my learning abilities i have to to work like harder than anyone else it affected my level of confidence to achieve certain goals the change happened when i found my passion in they when i was graciously accepted in a film school the lecturers they accept me for who i am and no special treatment given to me i do not want to be be treated specially anymore i have been pursuing photography as a passion because i found joy in tering beautiful moments of people joy over to someone else that they feel even motivated after a long week of work i feel very encouraged even though sometimes they don't say it but you know that you've done your part even through a photo or through a conversation through a word i've gone through a a lot my childhood i don't want others to to seal the same i feel that the people who are born with this medical condition entreplats are being shelfved away they have not been spoken about this was my purpose and motivation to come out and to share about this condition one thing i'll tell my younger self not to allow other people's comments feedback take they stepped forward to understand myself better than to have the confidence in myself
