i was told that i'm being ignorant like every time they tried to call my name i did not respond i feel confused and the moment i was diagnosed with moderate hearing loss i did ask myself a lot is this the end of my career am i still able to work in the ward like you need to look after a cancer patient oh yesterday he got uh hair pain lah so they take all the oh okay after i informed my nurse manager but my hearing loss she was also worried initially but she was always there for me lah she was telling me why not you give it a try and perform it with hearing it this time maybe things will get better out of kindness she's give me a chance for me to pursue my passion when i was younger i actually want to be a nurse because i was brought up by my single mother so whenever i'm witness my mum fall sick when i was younger i feel so helpless and i did not know what to do so at that point of time i keep telling my mum and promise my mum like you know what i'm going to be a nurse one day so that whenever you fell sick right then i know what to do next because of my promise to my mum ah that keeps me going ah a new hearing eight users you tend to hear all the background noises that you haven't been hearing for the past 20 years sometime the hospital environment can be very loud i i'll be scanning and there's a bit sound then at the same time there's another bit sound the toilet call and telephone call at the same time yeah it's very overwhelming like i can hear all kinds of sounds like all come together so far from my experience my patient will not even know that i have hearing issues until i actually told them so uh it doesn't affect my performance and skills most of them cannot see unless you're right beside me cause it's just a transparent tu hanging around my ear Â especially for cancer patients after receiving the chemotherapy they will be prone to fall so it's very important for nurses like us to have a good hearing skills we have to be very alert lah so far so good ah no matter how many times i've seen my patient pass on due to cancer you will never be prepared when you love one diagnosed we cancer and last year my mum actually diagnosed with stage four cancer the doctor declared that she has to be in paative like you as comfortable as possible before the end of life lah ya so because of that i actually went back to malaysia just to look after my mum being a full-time caregiver it's scary to go through the process by herself she said that if i'm not around she would have died in the hospital instead of at home which is something that she didn't want to i was able to take care of her uh until her last day i slept with her until her last breath mm because her last words to to me was um i feel safe de huh ever since my mum passed on i actually switched to medical oncology because it's related to my mum's case and i would like to provide like best utnmos comfort care for the same situation as my mum mm mm
