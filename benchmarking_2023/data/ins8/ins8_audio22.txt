although the cemetery is a bit scary anything can happen inside no one know but then to me it's very peaceful you work alone you have your own time to do your stuff that's the greatest thing to me hi my name is rohaiza and i out in choa chu kang cemetery i lase flowers to the grave usually during this time's business in the cemetery right it's a bit busy but then due to covid-19 they ask us to shut down you know visitors are allowed to visit so i came up with this idea to do it online i will go down to the grave and lay flowers do minor cleaning i will send pictures before and after under the hot sun it's a bit tiring mm work alone in cemetery to tell you the truth ah actually i am a scary cat first thing it's a bit scary then i think back why i need to be scared i know one day i'm going to be there also so i changed my mentality up till today lah i enjoy there's a few heartwarming lah one of it her late mum just passed away then she also cannot visit because she is in australia after i leave flowers she call me again she cried over the phone and she say i very blessed to know that you i'm doing this to me very very touching because to touch someone hard right it's very very difficult it is not about the money in a way i'm just helping the community before this i'm a safety coordinator i've been working in that industry for more than four years my job also get affected due to the covid-19 so i was affected very badly so i don't know where to get income i don't have a very good education i drop out halfway during my i days so i told myself this is not a reason to stop me from being successful my type of person i don't like to give up easily example like covid-19 cannot physically sell flower if that's the case right we find other tournament we write online every closed path there's always a open path so never never give up never give up
