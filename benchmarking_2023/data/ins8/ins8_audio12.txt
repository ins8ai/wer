i just think that life is more beautiful with more colours it should not be just restricted to painting or flower arrangements i think food can also be fun with colours as well okay hello i'm joy from real life xiang delights selling imit noodles for the past three over years why do i make cuted banmian food has to be appealing by looking at it and you feel like you want to eat it i'm sure that your appetite will be much better as well it's made fresh every day we don't use any food colouring in our food when making the dough you see like it's meant to be a comfort food it's meant to be healthy if you use the food colour when you actually cook it all these colourings will actually come out when you take out the dough the dough probably be white if it is natural from the fruit itself or from the veggie itself the soup based will just be a slight ting of the colour mm i wanted the four primary colours of red blue yellow and green for red that's the beach road one the blue is the blue pee the yellow is the pumpkin the green one is thepage every different colour has got a different property so spinach because of its fibre for people who have file movement problem yeah that's also a very good thing big route is the antioxidant so there's a prevention of cancer pumpkin it's very rich in vitamin c it actually gives a glow bluepea if you consume it daily it can give you very good shiny hair promotes better eyesight so they have their own personality they have their own characteristics it's just like myleo it's fun playing with what you actually cook my mum is the main catalyst as to why i started to learn how to cook my grandmother passed away when i was 16 after that we kind of like lost a bread cook we started eating out and i noticed that my mum was eating lesser and lesser i think that throughout all these years my mum has always been very used to having home pooked food i told myself actually why not i could try so i started asking like my aunties people who i feel were really great cook and eventually i came up with my own recipes if it wasn't for her i think i would never have found my passion that hey i actually like cooking the best satisfaction comes when people come up to you and say that your banmian is really good it gives me that home cooked feel is much better than having a pay rice better than striking for the that's actually what is keeping me going they don't have to tell you that this is the best you don't have to be the best that will definitely be somebody better than you but as long as it's something that when they eat it they feel that this is the right taste for them i think that is that is good enough for me
