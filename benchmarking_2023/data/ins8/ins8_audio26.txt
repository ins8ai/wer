then when they were done they open the door i'm like hey hi i'm z hi i'm happy hello i'm tong hi aun li yan and this is that what is that it's a chick i don't i guys want many episode of chit chat and in today episode we're gonna be talking about staying in hall in university so which uni were you from and which hall were you guys from i was from n t u at hotel i was from n t u also from the that's all wild wild wild price i was in n u s i am in n u s and i lived in k r and n ha so for me i stayed in residential college so it's somewhat like a hall but it's in new town they have their own programme i stay in terms also yeah that's where the nerds are at mm fair eh but the let's the let are cool and that's are real cool so moving on let's talk about your own personal hall experience so what are the rooms you stay in and also like do you have any like tories to share about like mas or like four stories in hall uh i stayed in a double room so for n t u i is good cause you can actually choose your roomie before you going so thankfully i chose like my friend and we are still friends ah that's because having a roommate right your dynamic with them completely changes ya it's the friendship there are stories of people who like stop being friends with their roomie for my first two years i stay roommate and then uh in my remaining time in hall i stayed in single room so you like single or double better i enjoyed staying at the double room because i always have a roommate and it didn't get back lonely lah on the other hand a single room is great also because like things can go my way easier like in terms of the clean up in terms of uh explain to my room to my room ya so you know you know ya feel like there's some hidden message behind all these i live in kent ridge for one year year one sem two and year two sem one and then when i did end of that was year two sem two that was when i stayed in p d i live in a single room because they only have single room and then in the evening when there's son through my windows wah so nice sia i live there i super nice and then i had all these fake flowers mm i tuck them around my bed frame so like it was just the dreamest room i ever had i think for me i had the best of both worlds like which is a single room but also i the company of other people because i stay in a sleep that has like a shared common area but you cannot choose your sea mates ya so you just heng suay whether you get school roommates or not for my first year the roommates i stay with all seniors so we will just like hi bye but i was very very lucky when i was here to all people that i could click with so they are still my closest friends started now and then like two of them will exchange the school i still keep in contact with do you have any uh chey roommate gossip stories to share i know of this couple that always appears in my friend's i g story have been something outside the door up for like i think a good five minutes before they going to the room oh no but actually building on that right it's like the seeing into other people okay so rc is like the building that i build very near other like hdb right so if you're on the top floor of this rc you can look down into the lower floor of another rc people don't realise that and then they leave their blinds open so my friend one time it's like guys i looked out my window i just saw this a couple having side i was like what and then it's like everybody's talking about it in the chat and it's damn bad cause like how did you tell them also what right then just be aware and close your blinds maybe it's a very important room i didn't see anything with my own eyes but that's what i heard i think the quite thin ah mm so when study too hard you know sometimes it can be heard what then when they start wah this thing damn hard it hard damn hard i get what you mean by the wall it was my friend's room i walked past her door and then i heard like oh my god then i put my ears then i i stood with my door open then i lean against the door frame like that wait for them how do you wait this girl damn creepy ah then when they were done they open the door i'm like hey they just laughing and tell me go so moving on to hall activities what are some of activities that you guys participated in so the way it works in halls at least for n u s is that if you want to stay on you need to accumulate points into points you need to pass events functions run by either your block or your hok so i didn't join anything i'm not particularly proud about it because i feel like hall is a great way to pick up new things and new skills i didn't had to experience for myself cause i was very busy talking your school also couldn't really accumulate points but because i spend a lot of time with my blockmate uh they helps me to stay on for the next semester so i think r t we have the same things but we call them like interest groups at least in term also one of the groups that i think my friend started was t gradr which is the l g b t q plus uh group there's support a lot of the l g b t q plus people in the hall itself in terms of that's something that i feel makes the most a little bit different ya in terms of like what we offer i spend a lot of time in n u s so like the club the club itself the biggest thing that i did was to take my hall dance at the start of the year there will be a dance competition we all hall to cone together so that was really fun and also i think hall is a very good place actually to try something we never tried before like in terms of uh commitments and roles i joined as a group leader for orientation camp i was also in the hall community something i like about n u we have this thing called h there are like a lot of different kind of sports and like recreational activities what is your biggest culture shop when you for halls there's like a shared century right and then that's where right you realise some people are super gross have microwave oven and there are stories of people who use the oven as like to drive the stocks so in the older horse please don't use the microave oven sometime even the urine know it's quite high right sometime it's like ya i think the biggest culture shock for me right what's the party in culture especially at the start of the semester then they are just always like you want to go out drinks you want to drink in my room even though it is strictly banned and people get into so much troubles and they started to clamp down very strongly towards the end of my whole day lah ya oh also the sex culture so i heard of how there are whatsapp chats more that are just for hookups it's a rumour nobody has actually seen the chair oh you have anyways okay i i have not seen the treum you know they don't believe that have fallen about these things the peer pressure if people around you are doing things that you don't believe in it just be own person i don't know about n t u but i know like in n u s like if something happens ah wah the whole hall know about it like the next day that kind of thing just be aware of like your actions lor ya what is your biggest takeaway from staying in hall i think although there's a lot of like weird stories about hall and weird things that's going on i still really enjoyed my c c a cause it really gave me a chance to like learn how to live on my own and another bigthy is definitely the friends that i've made cause there are people who have seen you at your worst there's people who you can just definitely knock at the door uh and then go inside to top if you feel down or anything i think the biggest takeaway for me will also be my friend these are the people who have been there for you lah because they are so accessible at the same time they are also very like i would say very like minded lah in a way independence is one of the biggest takeaways that you're gonna get cause for the first time in my life i had a place to call my own and everything that was within this little faith right belongs to me and it felt so good it inspired me to want to work towards that again some may be able to look at the place and say that i only say the biggest take away from me and s stay in rc or even hall right made my whole unique experience a lot easier ya because i had something to go back to all the time after like a very long day of classes and like friends who can uh kind of empathise with what i'm going to and also i think is a lot about taking initiative and learning how to like up your own project and lead your own project in hall ya because a lot of times you don't have the opportunity to do that outside so last question will be uh any advice to the fellow people who are entering her in august i think anything like what you say for stay true to yourself but i think still go inside with a very open mind cause there's a lot of new experiences you are going to enter into there's lot of new things you can try new things you can make so i think it's gonna be a very exciting time nonetheless lah i to completely agree with whatever she has said remember to have fun you know ya because like some people they just go they just like have hall to just study or like there's a place for them to rest after school and what not but they sometimes forget about the fun aspect of uni life fun i feel like the fun element can people might over emphasise on that sometimes as well so like those who get very into all the activities and it might become very overwhelming for you and just find a support system know who you can rely on and who you can talk through all your struggles with and it will help you a lot through your new journey think my uh ba advice is prioritise that time because that's something a lot of people don't realise so you know that whole triangle everyone like you want to study and social life then people always choose to study and social life and then they don't like get enough time for themselves i think that is something very important don't lose yourself in hall prioritising your own mental health is uh great light right ya today we talked about hall culture and we learnt that as long as you stay truth to yourself you're gonna enjoy everything and your new experience so if you guys like this video remember to leave a comment down below and also let us know what else to talk about next
