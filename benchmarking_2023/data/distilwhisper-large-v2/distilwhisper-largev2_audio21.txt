 I see some people in the toilet searching for where is the sensors? I will stand beside him on the next basin and then I just... There. Water coming out. Oh, magic. Okay. There? Oh, magic. Oh, this is a surprise. You want to open up? I'm Prima. Are you the king of toilets? I'm not the king of toilets. So what are you? Well, I'm a R&D manager, overseeing all the designs for different fittings in the toilet all the way to manufacturing. This is not my favorite seat, but this seems very comfortable with them. I thought you called Zieping. So every shopping center I would like to visit the toilet, and then I'll see how the product performs. I look at one thing, wow, very interesting, then I'll stay there and watch. But people when they pass by, I'll just, pay day, be it, just walk. What do you want me to do? Like that? This one is very good also. Are you also expert at uncle or the toilet? Wow, actually you don't use this, you just wrap the bowl, airtight, then you flush. So there will be a pressure suction inside. That I learned from YouTube. You all do not see YouTube. Currently, Riga is manufacturing about 44,000 toilet bowls per year. That breaks down to around 12,000 per month. Not only for Singapore market, it's also exporting to around 26 other countries in the world. Some people actually don't know that Uyghur is a Singapore brand. They thought that it's an international brand. So it really makes me quite proud. Once you go to China Airport please visit the toilets so you can see our sensor panel right with a smiley face that is to welcome the our visitor from overseas. We also have smart toilet in exponent. Our IoT system actually collects per usage, how much water is being consumed. Even in the toilet row where it's empty, there's a alert sent out to the cleaner mobile to tell them to top up to make her job easier. Well in the past, manufacturing sector will manufacture a lot, but there's not much technology being put in. Nowadays, where we're talking about smart nations, in Singapore especially, we have to apply a lot of technologies. That's why you see a lot of young engineers like to join IGERS just because they are being excited by all these technologies and they really want to apply their skill sets into developing new products. Since we are in the toilet business right so R because it's a company that gives a lot of toilet breaks on it. So you can spend the whole day inside the toilet, nobody will complain. Thanks.
