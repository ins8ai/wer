 I find it quite terriputic to clean dishes. You have no cares in the world. In Hawkins we say, la-sab-e-sha, la-s-a-toe. It's like, you eat dirty, you grow up dirty. But sometimes I ask, what am I doing in my life? When I first started, a dishwasher, it was a real struggle. I was very scared of the dirt and the field. food sometimes because the smell it will make you like gag. Healing is the bread and butter of my family. My mom, she actually has been in this line for quite a while now. A couple of decades, in fact. I really respect her a lot because she is so breadwinner she brought me and my sister up single-handedly. I was faced with a decision on whether I should go to uni or come into this dishwashing line to help my mom. But I realized that maybe you don't need a degree to wash dishes. Yeah, I don't think she can keep going at this pace much longer. So yeah, I just needed to step in to help elevate this burden of her. Thank you. My colleagues are all very old. Yeah, they like my alma's age. It's just very wholesome I feel. Sometimes it's like you're warm too to thrown you. You're like... It's just very wholesome, I feel. Sometimes, it's like, I'm working withan's the earth, right? Technically like a la-banian's their the their true sometimes. It's like they would actually buy me meal sometimes. It's like they see me as their own brakid. I feel like people can't respect you if you don't know how to do it. If you want to manage something, you have to learn the nature of it. The best way is by doing it. And if they have anything that they're struggling with or things that could be improved in terms of processes. Yeah, I wanted to make that change. It was also tough because sometimes when I bump into people that actually know, they would see like, oh, like how bad did he mess up his life to be cleaning today and like washing dishes or like during the trash. If I were to say like, oh yeah, this is my mom's company, I'm working. I feel that it's very snobbish. It discredits all the hard work that I put in. Being a servant doesn't mean that you're the lowest. In fact, it's a joy to serve people. Growing up without a dad, it made me somewhat insecure sometimes. But it was in church that I found my confidence. So I think growing up like that, it has also stuck with me that, yeah, I can find joy in serving people. I started to turn my coping mechanism to humor. So if people ask me, boy, you're son't, why you're tel you're tel you're tel you, oh boy, you're son't you're tel you're all. I'll tell them, oh, now hankin't not. Time's a tough. Whatever puts food on the table. Gotta keep dripping, the-shae-shaeat. This is really an honest living and you're serving the society. You're doing something that not many people wants to do. It just so happens that for me it's cleaning and might not be the most glamorous but yeah it's still a form of serving people. They're always just in the background, but they are the invisible force that keeps your everyday life running. So I just hope that next time anyone sees a younger person cleaning, it's not because they messed up their life, but it is still a honest job. It is not put food on the table for my sister and I growing up. you
