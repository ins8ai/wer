 Although the cemetery is a bit scary, anything can happen inside, no one knows. But then to me it's very peaceful. You work alone, you have your own time to do your stuff. That's the greatest thing to me. Hi, my name is Rohizat and I help out in a Chorchukang cemetery. I release flowers to the grave. Usually during this time business in the cemetery right it's a bit busy. Then due to COVID-19, they asked us to shut down. No visitor are allowed to visit. So I came out with this idea to do it online. I will go down to the grave and lay flowers, do minor cleaning. I will send pictures before and after. Under the Hotshann, it's a bit tiring. Work alone in cemetery. To tell you the truth, actually, I am a scary cat. First week, it a bit scary, then I think back why I need to be scared. I know one day I'm going to be there also. So I change my mentality up to today, I enjoyed. There's a few heartwarming runs. One of it, her late mom just passed away. Then she also cannot visit because she is in Australia. After I lay flowers, she called me again. She cried over the phone and she said, I'm very blessed to know that you are doing this. To me, very, very touching. Because to touch someone hard, right, it's very, very difficult. It's not about the money. In a way, I'm just helping the community. Before this, I'm a safety coordinator. I have been working in that industry for more than four years. My job also get affected due to the COVID-19, so I was affected very very badly so I don't know where to get income. I don't have very good education. I drop out halfway during my ITE days. So I told myself, this is not a reason to stop me from being successful. My third person, I don't like to give up easily. Example like COVID-19, cannot physically sell flowers. If that's the case, right, we find other tonity, we sell online. Every closed path, there's always an open path. So never, never give up, never give up. Thank you. you
