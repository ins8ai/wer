 I see some people in the toilet searching for where's the sensors. I stand beside you on the next basin and I just... Water coming out. Oh, magic. Oh, this is a surprise. You want to open up? I'm Primaan. Are you the king of toilets? I'm not the king of toilets. So what are you? Well, I'm an R&D manager overseeing all the designs for different fittings in the toilet all the way to manufacturing. This is not my favourite seat but this seems very comfortable. How do you call it? So every shopping centre, I would like to visit the toilet and then I'll see how the product performs. I'm looking at one thing, wow, very interesting, then I will stay there and watch. But you also expert at unclogging toilets? Wow, actually you don't use this ah, you just grab the bowl, add like, then you'll flush it. makes me quite blocked once you go to Chang Airport please visit the toilets so you can see our sensor panel right with a smiley face that is to welcome our visitor from overseas we also have smart toilet in toilet in Exponent. Our IoT system actually collects her usage, right? How much water is being consumed. Even in the toilet row where it's empty, there's an alert sent out to the cleaner mobile to tell them to top up, to make her job easier. Well, in the past, manufacturing sector, it will manufacture a lot, but there's not much technology being put in. Nowadays, where're talking about smart nations, in Singapore especially, you have to apply a lot of technologies. That's why you see a lot of young engineers like to join the Uyghurs just because they are being excited by all these technologies and they really want to apply their skill sets into developing new products. Since we're in the toilet business right, so Uyghur is a company that gives a lot of toilet breaks. So you can spend the whole day inside a toilet. Nobody will complain.
