 Although the cemetery is a bit scary, anything can happen inside. No one knows. But then to me, it's, they asked us to shut down. No visitors are allowed to visit. So I came up with this idea to do it online. I will go down to the grave and lay flowers, do minor cleaning. I will it's a bit scary. Then I think back, why I need to be scared? I know one day visit because she is in Australia. After I left flowers, she called me again. She cried over the phone and she said, I'm very blessed to know that you are doing this to me very very touching. Because to touch someone's heart, it's very very difficult. It's not about the money. In a way, I'm just helping the community. Before this, I'm a safety coordinator. I have been working in that industry for more than four years. My job also get affected due to the COVID-19. So I was affected very badly. So I don't know where to get income. I don't have a very good education. I drop out halfway during my IT days. So I told myself this is not a reason to stop me from being successful. My third person, I don't like to give up easily. Example, COVID-19 cannot physically sell flowers. If that's the case, we find other quality. We sell online. Every closed path, there's always an open path. So never, never give up. Never give up. you
