 Ms Yeo Wan-ling asked about our plans to expand our youth leadership programs to provide younger student leaders the opportunity to engage on national issues and also to build strong networks. NYC and the National Community Leadership Institute, or NACLI, in partnership with MOE, piloted the inaugural OSLP, our Singapore leadership program, last year. This was a program as a pilot for about 50 Sec4 students from MOE schools and Madrasas. It took place in December 2022. All the student leaders who participated in this inaugural OSLP came from different schools. In other words, we had 50 of, I think it was about 53 different participants from 53 different schools. Leader is defined broadly and some were heads of student councils, some were participants in their dance groups and others captains of their sports teams or members of the uniform groups. Leaders defined in a very broad, inclusive fashion. We brought them together. They came together to reflect on and discuss issues which confront Singapore. They talked about grapple with trade-offs and the complexities of policy designs. And they also expanded on their network of friends, people that they can talk to, connections that they can make, forge new friendships. We found this program very successful and we want to give more youth an opportunity to take part in this program. From 2023, we will expand the program to nominated Sec 4 students from all MOE schools and madrasas in Singapore. For students from the Institute of High Learning, NYC will develop a new leadership programme and more details will be shared when ready. Mr. Tse Ochien has pointed out, and I agree with him, there is value in having and promoting active citizenry, volunteerism and collaboration, and these traits must continue to underpin our society and our social compact. Beyond youths, we are encouraging individuals and corporates to play an even more active role in coming together, work for the social good, leverage on corporate purpose, and uplift our communities. We will therefore expand and deepen the capabilities of our SG Cares volunteer centres. We will resource them better so that they in turn can support the various social service agencies that are under their watch and they are working with. And we can better channel volunteers and donations in kind to meet unmet needs. We will also support businesses in their efforts to be a force for good for society as they design their business practices and operations in ways that benefit their employees, their stakeholders and of course the wider community that they serve. Moss Elbin will share more details when he speaks.
