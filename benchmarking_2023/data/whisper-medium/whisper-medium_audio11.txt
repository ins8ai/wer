It says out there, if you want to make people happy, sell ice cream So I decided to buy my own Gelato machine to make it install And now I'm very happy when customer feedback to me and came back to me that this is the real galato. They call me Katie, Katie Tan. I'm 69 this year and Auntie is 73. Both of us run this galato business. I have at any time 20 flavors displayed here. The popular one is pistachio, hazelnut. Some people they taste the garrato, they can dance on the spot. They're all, oh my God. And they start dancing. I'm happy. When I see that, I'm happy. We've been married for 49 years already. We worked the hard way through in life. I was only secondary to education and Auntie was only family school education. That time we do the sewing cotton rack and then we do a small business. That time one son leave. No place to stay. We have a Honda Civic small car. Then sometimes we sleep in the car also. From beginning, I together with him, everything I have to take care. Take care his job. The servant? After we retired, we were in our 60s. Then we went for three years traveling. Most of the time we were cruising. We were still very healthy and able to travel around. You have a favorite pastime together? At this age, even if you're a failure, there's nothing to fear because it's a good time to call it a full retirement. As long as we can continue to work, I think we'll just continue. As long as we're happy, then we're happy now.
