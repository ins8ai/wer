 Although the cemetery is a bit scary, anything can happen inside, no one knows. But then to me, it's visitor are allowed to visit. So I came up with this idea to do it online. I will go down to the grave and lay flowers, minor cleaning I will send pictures before and after Under the hot sun, it's a bit tiring To tell you the truth, actually I am a scaredy cat First week, it's a bit scary Then I think back,, why I need to be scared? I know one day, I'm going to be there also. So I changed my mentality. Up to today, I enjoy. There's a few heartwarming runs. One of it, her late mum just passed away. Then also couldn't visit because she's in Australia. After I laid flowers, she called me again. She cried over the phone and said, I'm very blessed to know that you are doing this. To me, it's very, very touching. Because to touch someone's heart, it's very, very difficult. It's not about the money. In a way, I'm just helping the community. Before this, I'm a safety coordinator. I have been working in that industry for more than four years. My job also got affected due to COVID-19. So I was affected very badly. So I didn't know where to get income. I don't have a very good education. I dropped out halfway during my ITE days. So I told myself this is not a reason to stop me from being successful. My type of person, I don't like to give up easily. Example, like COVID-19, cannot physically sell flowers. If that's the case, right, we find other tonality. We sell online. Every closed path, there's always an open path. So never, never give up. Never give up. you
