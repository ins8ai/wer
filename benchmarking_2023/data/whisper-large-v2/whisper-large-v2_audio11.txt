 Apple CEO. What was his name? Steve Jobs. Yes, Steve Jobs. It says out there, if you want to make people happy, sell ice cream. So I decided to buy my own gelato machine to make it in-store. And now, I'm very happy when customers feedback to me and came back to me that this is the real gelato. They call me KT, KT Tan. I'm 69 this year and Aunty is 73. Both of us run this gelato business. I have at any time 20 flavours displayed here. The popular ones are pistachio, hazelnut, beret rocher, chocolate, strawberry, berlina. Some people, they taste the galato, they can dance on the spot. They'll go, oh my god! And they start dancing. I'm happy. When I see them happy, I'm happy. We've been married for 49 years already. We worked the hard way through in life. I was only in secondary 2 education and Aunty was only in family school education. That time we do the sewing cotton rack and then did a small business. At that time, there was only one son. No place to stay. We had a Honda Civic small car. Then sometimes we slept in the car also. From the beginning, I, together with him, everything I had to take care of. Take care of his job. Like a servant? We already retired 5 years ago. We work six days a week, from 11am to 11 because it's a good term to call it a full retirement. As long as we can continue to work, I think we'll just continue. As long as he's happy, then we're happy.
