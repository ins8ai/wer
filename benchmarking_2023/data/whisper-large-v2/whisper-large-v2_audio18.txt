 The girl was asking the father why the guy is so short. The usual questions that kids will ask out of curiosity. This is what you normally hear on the street? Yes. It's good that kids are asking. It shows that they are observant and their observation skills are pretty good. I found out about my condition when I was about four to five. I realised my classmates, their body proportions were different from mine. My legs and my hands were shorter. My head was bigger. They started to mock at me in terms of why my head was so big. It did kind of really, really disturb me. Why can't I lead a normal life? Does my head affect you? Like, why that comment? Why that question and stuff? One of the biggest struggles I face every day is not being able to reach things of a certain height that a normal person can do. So, for example, at home I will have to use a stool to reach something that is higher than me. But also, it trains me to find creative ways to overcome my problems. whether it's my parents born like that. That's why I'm like that. I don't blame them for asking because I'm more than happy at the age of four. I always blamed my condition for affecting my learning abilities. I had to work harder than anyone else. It affected my level of confidence to achieve certain goals. The change happened when I found my passion in fita'afid. When I was graciously accepted in a firm school, the lecturers, they accept me for who I am and no special treatment is given to me. I found joy in capturing long week of work. I feel encouraged. Even though sometimes they don't say it, but you know that you have done your part. Even through a photo, or through a conversation, through a word. I have gone through a lot in terms of growing in my childhood. I don't want others to feel the confidence in myself.
