 For my partner and I to make our living room what we consider cozy or in our bedroom like what we consider cozy is very nice. Like before going to bed I used to look at her now I look at the corner that I did. But I look at her in the morning. Okay, okay, okay. Okay and we are back for another episode of T-Talks. Yay! And we are here to talk about housing Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay!

Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Not married yet. I am getting a flat in Zhuang East in five years time in 2028. I'm Ben, I'm 32 this year. I'm married and I have a resale flat in Punggou. Yeah, I just moved in like two months ago. Bella 35, I stay in a private condo. It's a studio apartment so it's pretty small. So we're gonna play this game called, like, would you rather? So there are certain, like, options here. So would you rather A, spend less for a less ideal location? Or would you B, pay more for an ideal location? Okay, so who is A? Yay! Is the worst is? Yay! Maybe they did really spend less compared to us. Okay, so you all say pay less for less ideal location. So what's your forego and your choice? Not choosing Tiong Baru over Chorang East. I was at the top of my head before saying the price. I was like, Tiong Baru, because Tiong Baru curry rice to eat. In the stall move, you also move. No, but there's just a greater proportion of good food in that area. And then the estate also looks very nice and all, very chill but it's that kind of thing. But my situation is not ideal. It just says that I don't earn that much for me to afford that location. So I need to prioritise on whatever I can afford. So I decided to go for Zhuang East instead. Because I think Zhuang East is like, there's a lot of shopping malls and a lot of amenities there also. But Yule was location issue and issue? So actually my location is quite ideal already. Because I think when my partner and I were discussing right we kind of wanted either Pudong or Dampenis We liked Dampenis lah but we forego a lot of things because for us we weren't expecting to get a flat during that exercise but we did and when it was our turn to choose a flat we didn't have high floor options left So I mean as much as we wanted to also stay like 30 floor that kind right we don't have a choice lah so that's one thing that we had to forego Your location costs how much? Okay, not bongo per se, but like within the estate, I wanted something that was more accessible and had like facilities or amenities nearby. What is important for you? I think commute to work for one. Yeah, I think that was the main thing that my partner and I were looking at. Yeah, if you can't space out that cost, commute to work is further. I mean, but that's where you save on cost. And then you also stay near your parents. Correct, yeah. So I stay within, just nice within the 4km radius so I managed to get the proximity housing grant as well. So I think I was just like within 100m. If I throw a stone really, the stone won't get the grant. Nice. Okay, so since you all said you all paid less for a less ideal location, I don't know like how much did your house cost, like roughly? Mine was about 320K for a 4-room flat. Nice, nice. That's a good number. What about you? Around, it's similar to your cost, 370. Ah, okay, okay. I'm quite envious when I hear all the detail prices. Mine is resale right, so I paid about close to half a million there about for a 4 room. No, but then you get your flat faster also. Ya, you don't have to wait. It's true. I mean, you move in already, but they're still waiting. We are still in the waiting you know. We just see the model, then like, see the paper, the happy happy, then put on IGF five years later, see you, that kind. I don't think I can to like commit that and like you just see the model, I don't know. When you think about the cost, you can commit already. Thanks. So what about the cost for you? Okay, so Aya lah, here 300, here 500, then like I damn sin ah. Am I stupid for doing this? Because you all have partners. I bought this as a single. So my place for studio apartment which is damn tiny is 700. 700K. When I hear all of your amounts it's like oh my god more than double of. I can buy two BTOs. Two 4 room flags. Wait but where is it? You know us. I think I should make more friends in the east. Alright, you can move here, change your BTO. No, no, no. Then I'll invite you all to the west also. I think people won't go. But okay, you can try. Let me know in 5 years, I'll put it on my account. Oh yeah, in my house I'll make it. We are 2 friends I need to read that. I'm speaking properly and you cannot register. Okay. Who is A? I'm half-half. I cannot... Then you put your hand here. Why half-half? Say it first. I mean, clearly I bought a resale because I wanted the convenience of being able to move in right now, right? But at the same time, I see the benefits of having a B-team. Why have a safe place? We are very used to having our own space. I love living with my parents and I appreciate them for all that but I also really like having my own space so I don't think it's something that I can go back to. So I think we would still go for a resale. Actually, I think that's quite a great point because a lot of couples want that freedom also. For us, for me and my partner, sometimes we will just randomly chat about things and we will think about how nice it is if we had our own space Like now right? Yeah! Okay so the situation around me getting my video was that it was a decision that we didn't expect to make because it wasn't a very ideal unit for her and she really like the dream home she envisioned wasn't like fixing the car park on the 4th floor Yeah so why did your partner decide to keep the flat? If we don't like it down the road, if she cannot stand the carpark noises or whatever, we will just find a new place to live. It's not like we have to commit to something at this point in our lives. It's the idea that you make your dream home, not that the dream home is given to you. So Pei Fang, would you rent before you get your video? I haven't really thought of that question. You think now? Just now when you all were talking about it, I thinking at the back of my head, like, should I rent a house? Because a lot of people have asked me. And they are like, five years, it will be like 30 plus in that time already, then how to start a family, blah blah blah, I can't think. You're too old for that. Then I'm like, thanks for the reminder. You asked me for advice. Or maybe an alternative is similar to Yihong's case is my boyfriend will just come over and be with me. I mean I haven't brought up that topic at all. It's not something that we are considering at that moment. He also hasn't proposed yet. Yellow! Right! How can? Where is your proposal? I haven't even talked to him. So I think for Bella, she mentioned just now that she needs to pay 700K in a lump. Not really a lump sum. She don't have the 700K but yeah. Yeah correct. For us, at least we get the EHG grant and Hans housing grant. So basically it's a grant given by HDB for you to offset some of the costs of financing the house. I mean your house costs like 700K right, so how do you afford it? I can't afford it. The video ends here. Sometimes I wonder too. I think it's a commitment that you decided on right. So there will be certain life changes. Like previously I always thought of every few years I would live a year overseas but now with a house then you have to ask yourself can you afford it or I must always have a job. But definitely having such a big financial commitment is huge. Then just got to make adjustments to my lifestyle law. I cancelled Disney Plus subscription. Just really take note of every single month. Now I have a table of all my expenditure and all the loans I have to pay. I feel like a lot of people don't... I mean the people I know at least, didn't think about that until they committed to a housing option. For example, they would be like, oh yeah, I can afford it. But then when they go for the housing option that they want, then they realize, oh now I have to change the last one? Yes. Or buy a starter home and upgrade at a later time. Wow starter home like Minecraft eh. I think this is an A for me at the moment. Okay buy your dream house and stay in the long run. As in my current situation is an A for me. But is that what you will have chosen? I thought your dream house is Jeng Wairu please. That's dream A1. Then this is dream A2. So still dream house can consider Dream House Happy for you I mean they are Okay, Tiong Bahru is Dream A1 because of the location Location is ideal But Jurong Ease is A2 because The location is not as ideal as Tiong Bahru But height is great. The height is great. So it's still considered dream. Okay, that's my definition. So why then? Why were you all like, this is starter and not the dream? I mean, cost is a big thing, obviously. Like for example her dream home, like I said, is a condo right? But given our current finances, it's a bit hard for us to look at a condo and be like, I want to buy it. Then your dream home? My dream home is as long as it's nice and it has a very nice kitchen, I'm happy with it. But unfortunately, that also means there are a lot of condos right? Because the kitchen is very small right? So we do have to like weigh our pros and cons lah. But happy wife happy life, she wants condo but we try to get it. Actually you should have said, for you, your home is where my babe is, that's home. of having a video that a lot of people don't necessarily think about is the fact that waiting isn't a bad thing. Waiting means that you have time to build up your finances, you have time to progress in your career to a more stable to be able to finally decorate and make something your own. Everyone has a different idea of cosy. So for us, for my partner and I to make our living room what we consider cosy or in our bedroom, what we consider cosy is very nice. Before going to bed, I used to look at her, now I look at the corner that I... But I look at her in the morning. So as first-time house owners, what are your most excited about? I want to hear how Phefang's one is. But I need to think. I haven't really thought about it. I think I'm also excited to host my first house party. Eh, I'm very excited also about that. This one's the excitement in real. This is what you're excited about. Not the decorating. No, that one. Then after that, when it's so nice really right, then it invites people to your house. Then you are like, wow, look at people's house. Because I've been going to a lot of house parties. I think it's having that space to yourself to be able to invite people over and I don't know, create memories in that house. Good vibes. It's nice that I've friends over. When did he invite you? He just moved in only. He still got all the cover. So, take some time and give him some time. Oh yeah, correct. Sorry. You all have been busy. I think a lot of people definitely would want to get some advice if they can. on the whole process of being a first-time householder. So what's the most important advice that we'll actually give to people who are looking to get their first place? I think being a first-time homeowner can be quite daunting to a lot of people. And sometimes in the process of getting the house, you might feel like you'll never get what you want. What's more important is that as long as you learn how to manage the good to have versus the must have right, you will still eventually get a nice place. A place that you can call your own. Yeah, actually the ideal home that you have in your head is really just a concept right? Any of the things. Yeah, it's like if it fulfills your must have then I think it's good enough. Yeah, the ideal home. Because it can be a subtle home. Yeah, the ideal home is just a place for us to host our parties. I just want to add on also, because everyone has different opinions about what an ideal home is. For example, we have three Easties and one Westies. Then every time I could not diss, my house is like, why the Wests are very good-made locations? At the end of the day, I would be like, no, very curious about the West. Little bit of y'all go there with very high expectations. Yeah, I won't disappoint. The West won't disappoint y'all. I hope it has been great listening to the experience of different types of home owners. If you have any questions, you can leave it in the comments section and I hope you enjoyed this episode. Thank you! Thank you! Bye bye!
