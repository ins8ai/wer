 Apple CEO. Ah... What was his name? Steve Jobs. Yes, Steve Jobs. He said sell that. If you want to make people happy, sell ice cream. So I decided to buy my own Galato machine to make it in stock. And now I'm very happy when customer feedback to me and came back to me that this is the real Galacto. They call me KT, KT Tan. I'm 69 this year and Auntie is 73. Both of us run this Galacto business. I have at any time 20 flavors displayed here. The popular one is like pistachio, hazelnut, beret ros√©, chocolate, strawberries, melina Some people they taste the garato, they can dance on the spot They'll, oh my god! And they start dancing I'm happy, when I see them happy,'m happy. We've been married for 49 years already. We worked the hard way through in life. I was only secondary to education and auntie was only primary school education. That time we do the sewing cotton rag and when we do a small business. That time one son only. No place to stay. We have a Honda Civic small car. Then sometime we sleep in the car also. From beginning, I together with him, everything I have to take care of his job. Like a servant. After we retired, we were in our sixties. Then we went for three years travelling. Most of the time we were cruising. We were still very healthy and able to travel around. We worked six days a week from 11am to 11pm. Despite being 69, we don't feel tired at all. At this age, even if you fail, there's nothing to fear because it's a good term to call it a full retirement. As long as we can continue to work, I think we'll just continue. As long he's happy, then we're happy.
