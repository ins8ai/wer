 I just think that life is more beautiful with more colours. It should not be just restricted to painting or flower arrangement. I think food can also be the past three over years. It's meant to be a comfort food. It's meant to be healthy. If you use a food colour, when you actually cook it, all these colourings will actually come out. When you take out the dough, the dough will probably be white. If it is natural from the fruit itself or from the veggie itself, the soup base will just be a slight tinge of the colour. I wanted the four primary colours of red, blue, yellow and green. For red, that's the beetroot one. The blue is the blue pea. The yellow is the pumpkin. The green one is the spinach. Every different colour has got its different properties. So spinach, because of its fibre, for people who have bowel movement problems, that's also a very good thing for them. Beetroot is an anti-oxidant. So there's a prevention of cancer, pumpkin. It's very rich in vitamin C. It actually gives a glow. Blue pea, if you consume it daily, it can give you very good shiny hair, promotes better eyesight. So they have their own personality, they have their own characteristics. It's just like my play-doh. It's fun playing with what you actually cook. My mom is the main capitalist as to why I started to learn how to cook. My grandmother passed away when I was 16. After that, we kind of like lost the great cook. We started eating out and I noticed that my mom was eating lesser and lesser. I think that throughout all these years, my mum has always been very used to having home cooked food. I told myself, actually why not? I could try. So I started asking my aunties, people who I feel were really great cooks. And eventually I came up with my own recipe. If it wasn't for her, I think I would never have found my passion that, hey, I actually like cooking. The best satisfaction comes when people come up to you and say, your farming is really good. It gives me that home-cooked feel. It's much better than having a pay rise, better than striking 40. That's actually what is keeping me going. They don't have to tell you that this is the best. You don't have to be the best. That would definitely be somebody better than you. But as long as it's something that, when they eat it, they feel that this is the right taste for them, I think that is good enough for me. you
