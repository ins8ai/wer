 Although the cemetery is a bit scary, anything can happen inside. No one knows. But to me, it's very visitors allowed to visit. So I came up with this idea to do it online. I will go down to the grave and lay flowers, do minor cleaning. I will send pictures before and after. Under the cocksand, it's a bit tiring. Work alone in cemetery. To tell you the truth, actually I am a scary cat. First week it's a bit scary. Then I think back, need to be scared. I know one day I'm gonna be there also. So I changed my mentality up to today lah. I enjoy. There's a few heartwarming. One of it her late mom just passed away. And she also cannot visit because she is in Australia. After I laid flowers, she called me again. She cried over the phone and she said, I'm very blessed to know that you are doing this to me very, very touching. Because to touch someone hard, right, it's very, very difficult. This is not about the money. In a way, I'm just helping the community. Before this, I'm a safety coordinator. I've been working in that industry for more than four years. My job also got affected due to the COVID-19. So I was affected very badly, so I don't know where to get income. I don't have very good education. I drop out halfway during my IT days. So I told myself this is not a reason to stop me from being successful. My third person, I don't like to give up easily. Exampleple like COVID-19, cannot physically sell flowers. If that's the case, we find other tournaments, we sell online. Every closed path, there's always an open path. So never, never give up, never give up. you
