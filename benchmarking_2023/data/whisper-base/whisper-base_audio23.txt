 I think being unwanted is a thing that I shall go with my whole life. You're above parents door you, your adoptive parents, I learned that parent-child relationships are not indeed navigate. On this episode of Canasme, I speak to Dewey, who at two years old, found out she was adopted by her parents. My good mom and my mom was in the midst of a conversation Then like, they talk about me being adopted Then it was like, huh? Wait, I adopted Then my mom was just kind like, yeah But I think it was only when I grew up and I go school at that level Actually, everyone's mother is their real mother Then I'm the only one with the what I think mother It's a very, very weird feeling The thing is, I still see her as my mother Because I still call her mommy and everything. But it's like when I see other people's parents do certain things for their kids and she don't do it right. The the way I saw my mum. Because one that taught registers, anytime my mum treats me badly or anytime I feel a sense of unfairness, a very directives to the fact that Next one. Of course, man. I think being unwanted is a thing that I shall go with my whole life, right? Because like, in my head, especially as a kid, there was immature, above parents door you, your adoptive parents, ensuring you enough love and attention. So it feels like you're unwanted. Since birth and at home, it always feels like I have to over able to make people laugh. I mean I love to make people laugh but sometimes also feel like I have to have just sense of validation like hey hey, I like this girl, I want her to be my friend that can't think. I remember I had this one girl friend that I was very close to at the point of time, her mom came to pick her up and then their relationship was very like very close. They were almost like best friends. Yeah, I was like, oh shit. Then I got very jealous. Yeah, never mind about crying the car. Do you think those emotions are too something that you feel about now? Oh no! Oh no! I feel like your childhood will still be like, how you say? How you never matter what. Especially because I really struggled with the whole adoption and being unwanted thing for so long. In my head or school my birth parents, If you can't raise a kid, don't give up to me and like put me in this world with these bunch of stupid parents. Especially my mom. It's like if you don't even show me that you love me, then why are you scolding me and treating me like that? And that's why we had a very very very bad relationship. I felt really lonely. I felt... It was in secondary school, right? I taught myself. You know what? I think I'm alone in this world. And I think only I can get what I want in life. I think that was like... The mean idea I'm feeling that felt like the mean idea I'm feeling like dropped. Am I? Tasty, yes! Mustard in panic of people, right? I feel like I'm losing control again. So I still struggle with it. Like every day. Would you look for your biological parents? I would say no now, because I don't really have time for that because... Like, if I find them, I don't know how I feel if I actually meet them. I think it'll be a mix of emotions. But I feel like eventually, as life go by, I feel like it'll be one of my life missions to really just meet who gave off to me, made me like for example sometimes I can be very emotional sometimes I can be a bit too angry Sometimes I'll ask myself do I get these traits from my birth parents? So I always want to like get them get to know them as a person right and see if there are any similarities between me and them and I should yeah I feel but it's like if I think as present me who is a bit more her buff mom. But we closure for her. I don't need fï¿½ure, I'm good. My name is Shee does. Yeah. What does family mean to you? I feel like I'm on an episode of Barney. Okay. No one in my family is biologically related to each other. My brother is adopted. But then I think to me now, family is... I think it's just beyond blood. I think that makes us more of a family actually if you really think about it because there are families out there that are related but they don't even treat each other like family I feel like pregnant ladies right they have nine months to register that okay they have a kid inside their mom and aunt have that it's just like here's a kid they care of it love it Disappear in it and I think my mom is quite like I remember one day I I'm so sorry. I was so ungrateful. I should have been more grateful. And I realized that if I start being grateful, maybe I'll be happier and it worked. Right now, I feel like when I think about my future, it always involves my parents and my family. Last time, it was really selfish. It was just me and my future. But eventually, I hope I'll be rich enough, right? So my father can still go out, go play golf, I love kids, that's one. I still think that adoption is as beautiful as a thing as pregnancy is. But then I think I will try to conceive first. If I give birth right, the kid will be the first person I know or have met that is like biologically related to me. Yeah, I think I'll feel like I'm not alone anymore. And I think I'll be the best feeling in the world, because I... The younger me would say I finally have a family. Is there anything you would like to tell your adoptive parents? Um... Oh, shit. Yeah, ma'am, mom! Thank you for giving me life. Yeah, thank you for giving me a chance to... Giving me the chance to live life and giving me the potential to be great at life. I think even though we weren't sure a lot, I think it really made me the person. I mean yeah, there are things that they could have certainly done better for sure but no one thought them to be parents and I think that they really did their best so yeah I think I owe it to them for bringing me up and people can give both the kids but the ways I keep right I think it's hard yeah they are more often than they parents, which says a lot. Because not everyone can be a parent.
