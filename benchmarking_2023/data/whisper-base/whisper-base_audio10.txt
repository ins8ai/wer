 Ms. Yohwan Lin asked about our plans to expand our youth leadership programs to provide younger student leaders the opportunity to engage on national issues and also to build strong networks. NYC and the National Community Leadership Institute are neckly in partnership with MOE, piloted the inaugural OSLP, our Singapore Leadership Program last year. This was a program as a pilot for about 50 SEK-4 students from M.O.E. schools and Madrasas. It took place in December 2022. All the student leaders who participated in this inaugural OS L.P. came from different schools. In other words, we had 50, I think it was about 53 different participants from 53 different schools.

We found this programme very successful and we want to give more youth and opportunity to take part in this programme. From 2023, we will expand the programme to nominated SEK for students from all MOE schools and Madrasas in Singapore. For students from the Institute of High Learning, NYC will develop a new leadership programme and more details will be shared when ready. Mr. Seyau Chen has pointed out and I agree with him. There is value in having and promoting active citizenry, volunteerism and collaboration and these traits must continue to underpin our society and our social compact. Beyond youths, we are encouraging individuals and corporates to play an even more active role in coming together, work for the social good, leverage on corporate purpose, and uplift our communities. We will therefore expand and deepen the capabilities of our SGK's volunteer centres. We will resource them better so that they in turn can support the various social service agencies that are under their watch and they are working with. And we can better channel volunteers and donations in Kain to meet unmet needs. We will also support businesses in their efforts to be a force for good for society as they design their business practices and operations in ways that benefits their employees, their stakeholders and of course the wider community that they serve. Mos Elbent will share more details when he speaks.
