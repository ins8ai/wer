 Although the cemetery is a bit scary, anything can happen inside. No one knows. But then to me it's very peaceful. You work alone, you have your own time to do your art, it's a bit busy. Then due to Covid-19, they asked us to shut down. No visitor allowed to visit. So I came out with this idea to do it online. I will go down to the grave and lay flowers, do minor cleaning. I will send pictures before and after. It's a scary cat. First we eat a bit scary, then I think back why I need to be scared. I know one day I'm gonna be there also. So I changed my mentality up to today. I enjoy it. There's a few hardwoming rants. One of it, her late mom just passed away. Then she also cannot visit because she is in Australia. After I left flowers, she called me again. She cried over the phone and I said, I'm very blessed to know that you are doing this to me very, very touching. Because to touch someone's heart, it's very, very difficult. It's not about the money. In a way, I'm just helping the community. Before this, I'm a safety coordinator. I've been working in that industry for more than four years. My job also got affected due to the COVID-19. So I was affected very badly, so I don't know where to get income. I don't have a very good education. I drop off halfway during my ITE days. So I told myself this is not a reason to stop me from being successful. My third person, I don't like to give up easily. Example like COVID-19. Cannot physically sell flowers. If that's the case, we find other tonnety. We sell online. Every close path, there's always an open path. So never, never give up. Never give up. you
