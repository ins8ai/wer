 A Percy O. What was his name? Steve Jobs, yes, Steve Jobs. He says out there, if you want to make people happy, sell ice cream. So I decided to buy my own Galato machine to make it is stock. And now I'm very happy when customer feedback to me and came back to me, then this is the real galanto. They call me Katie, Katie Tan. I'm 69 this year and Auntie is 73. Both of us run this galato business. I have at any time 20 flavors displayed here. The popular one is like pistachio, hazelnut, chocolate, strawberry, and garlic. Some people they taste the caratote, they can stand on the spot. They're all... Oh my god! And they start dancing. I'm happy. When I see that, I'm happy. We've been married for 49 years already. We worked the hard way through in life. I was only secondary to education. And Auntie was only from preschool education. That time we do the sewing cotton red and then we do a small business, the time one sun will be no place to stay. We have a Honda Civic small cart, then sometime we sleep in the car or show. From beginning, I, I together with him, everything I have to take care of. Take care of his job. Like 60s. Then we went for 3 years travelling. Most of the time we were cruising. We are still very healthy and able to travel around. We worked 6 days a week from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Despite being 69, where I don't feel tired at all. He's a good term to call it a full retirement. As long as we can continue to work, I think we'll just continue. As long as we're happy, then we're happy.
