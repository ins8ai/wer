 On the dating apps people will... the guys will ask me... also you work in the CBD as well. Truthfully, I also work in the CBD. Yeah, yeah, the lunch is always very busy in the hawker centre. Then we get to the point where they will finally ask me about my profession and then I'll just have to tell them. Yeah. My name is Faisai. Pranik. And I run a small coffee store in a more stringed food centre called Coffee Break. I think my friends in the beginning, they don in improving the business like our point of self-system, our staffing system. Before I started as a copy-hawker, I was actually a full-time athlete. So I used to play beach volleyball for Singapore. The precious of playing on court versus having to deal with a lunchtime slam with a team behind you has many similarities. So usually our lunch starts coming at about 12 pm. So we're ready preparing for a walk. It I like the communication. What do you think of us? Thank you! Just shawhand it! We had a customer since my dad's time. And we first started out. He actually told us, say, your coffee actually really sucked from the start. But it's because I believe in your father and I believe in his children That's why I gave you guys a chance to start by you We were not always good when we first started out And I'm very thankful for the regulars who started by us And that's what we need Obviously it's you, Tai. Bye! I just think it's quite... special. My personal motto is to be reliable, to be here for my staff, my customers, everyday without fail, when we say we are going to be here. I do see myself doing this for the rest of my life. I enjoy the service, the rush, the adrenaline that comes every time I work at SLAM. When I'm older, probably my heart cannot take it, but until I cannot, I will keep doing it. you
