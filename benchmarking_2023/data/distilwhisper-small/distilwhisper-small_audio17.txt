 C-R-E-O-I-O-S, sorry, this one is what? E-R-E. What do you think of my silent creature? Little bit hard. You understand right? Later the video is out he better checks up like those. I skater than that committee is going. I'm waiting. I'm one of the co-founders of our coffee. Hi, my name, S-A-L-A-H-U-D-D-I-N I do service and prepare food and drinks and cashing as well. If customer comes in, how you communicate with them. So customer will write and point at the menu and write with PAD,-D-I-P-P-P-P-E-P-T-E-T-E-T-A-T-A-W-D-N-I-D-N-I-N-I-T-N-I-T-A-T-A-T-A-T-A-A-T-A-A-T-A-A-A-T-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A While Dean is deaf, we also have James with autism and Joshua with male intellectual disability. If there's no thing, they will take a longer time to do things. He's the one that would push them to do faster and to meet timing. For YouTube Island, the alphabet side. Next other stuff is either he or Pauline teach. But will make you feel very very angry. It's more of the things in the cafe, which they forgot how to do, and then you'll just be more patient to teach them again repeatedly. Sometimes people with special needs do get anxious easily because of sudden changes in the environment or if you try to throw them in an unexpected situation. So that's the thing with working with my supervisors. They are very very patient people and that's why I also need to come in and tell them they have to share with me and not just keep quiet to themselves. They also didn't want me to worry about it. He put me quite a few skills, like cutting skills when using a knife and it's a very kind and caring person and then also very encouraging. Were you worried you cannot find a job? Part to find job with death. So you share with your family that you are the supervisor and then you are surprised. Yeah. What makes you feel happy, okay, here? The staff, the customers, and with other supervisors, they go out many times together. The idea for a social enterprise came about during like my undergraduate years, learning about the different marginalized communities and feeling injustice, I know how it feels like to not be included in activities with friends and so and so forth. So if these group of people in our society are being left out, how can I then create something on the largest scale for other people to also accept them meaningfully into society, we don't put up science to say that we have people with disabilities because my staff also want to manage any customers that come along the way. I think that's part of the job that we all want to do, yeah, regardless of the ability. you
