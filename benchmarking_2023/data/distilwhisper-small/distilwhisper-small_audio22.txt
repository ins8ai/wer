 Although the cemetery is a bit scary, anything can happen inside. No one knows. But then to me, it's very peaceful. You work alone, you have your own time to do your stuff. That's the greatest thing to me, Lan. Hi, my name is Rohaijan and I pop up in a chochukang cemetery. I place flowers to the grave. Usually during this time business in the cemetery, right, it's a bit busy. then due to COVID-19, they asked us to shut down. No visitor allowed to visit. So I came out with this idea to do it online. I will go down to the grave and lay flowers, do minor cleaning. I will send pictures before and after. Under the question, it's a bit tiring, lah. Work alone in cemetery, yeah. Okay, to tell the truth, I actually am a scary cat. Personally, it's a bit scary. Then I think back, why I need to be scared? I know one day I'm gonna be there also. So I change my mentality up to today, la. I enjoyed. There's a few hard women run. One of it, her late mom just passed away. She also cannot visit because she is in Australia. After I leave Flowers, she called me again. She cried over the phone as she said. I'm very blessed to know that you are doing this. To me, very, very touching. Because to touch someone hard, right? It's very, very difficult. It's not about the money,. In a way, I am just helping the community. Before this, I'm a safety coordinator. I have been working in that industry for more than four years. My job also get affected due to the COVID-19, so I was affected very badly, so I don't know where to get income. I don't have a very good education. I drop out halfway during my ITE days so I tell myself this is not a reason to stop me from being successful. My type of person, I don't like to give up easily. Example, like COVID-19, cannot physically sell flowers. If that's the case, right, we find other tonity, we sit online. Every close path, there's always an open park. So never, never give up, never give up. You know, you know.
