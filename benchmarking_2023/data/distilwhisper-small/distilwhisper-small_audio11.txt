 Aper CEO. What's his name? Steve Job, yes, Steve John. He says, sell that. If you want to make people happy, sell ice cream. So I decided to buy my own Galato machine to make it in stock. And now I'm very happy when customer feedback to me and came back to me that this is the real galato. They call me Tan. I'm 69 this year and Anti is 73. Both of us run this Galato business. I have any 20 flavors displayed here. The popular one is like pistachio hazelnut. Some people they taste the garato, they can dance on the spot. They'll all, oh my god! And they start dancing. I'm happy when I see the movie, I'm happy. Yeah. We've been married for 49 years already. We work the hard way through in line. I was only secondary to education and I'm team was only primary school education. The time we do the sewing cup and rent and when we do the sewing cotton rack and when we do a small business, that time once I'm living, no place to stay. We have a Honda City with small cart. Then sometimes we sleep in the car or so. From beginning, I, together with him, everything I have to take care of. Take care of his job. Like a, like a, for example. Like aa man yak, all right? We retired, we were in our 60s, Then we went for three years traveling. Most of the time we're cruising. We are still very healthy and able to travel around. We work six days a week from 11 AM to 11 PM. Despite being 69 where I don't feel tired at all. You have a favorite pastime? You have a favorite pastime. No longer. He will go pastime. He loves to work. He comes to work. I agree with this H.R. We come out from business or what. We can learn from y'all. If not you stay at home, you don't know anything. Like something empty, come down. At this age, even if you fail here, there's nothing to fear because it's a good time to call it a full retirement. As long as we can continue to work, I think we'll just continue. As long as we have been happy, then we have been left.
