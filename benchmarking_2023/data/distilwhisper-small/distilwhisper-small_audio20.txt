 I find it quite therapeutic to clean dishes? You have no cares in the world. In Hocken we say, lapsa, see, I love saptua. It's like, you eat dirty, you grow up dirty. Sometimes I ask, what am I doing in my life? When I first started, I guess a dishwasher. It was a real struggle. I was very scared of the dirt in the field. Mana, Signia! Okay, thank you, Bangh. You would see the grind and the rotting food sometimes. Because of the smell, it would make you like like gang. Heeding is the Britain bus fell of my family. My mom, she actually has been in this line for quite a while now. A couple of decades, in fact. I really respect her a lot because she is the sole breadwinner. She brought me and my sister up single-handed view. I was faced with the decision on whether I should go to unique or come into this dishwashing line to help my mom but I realize that maybe you don't need a degree to wash dishes. Yeah I don't think she can keep going at this pace much longer. So yeah, I just needed to step in to help elevate this burden of her. Thank you. My colleagues are all very old. Yeah, they like my almost age It's just very wholesome I feel sometimes is that I'm like they won me as their own bracket. I feel like people can't respect you if you don't know how to do it. If you want to manage something you have to learn the nature of it and the best way is by doing it and if they have anything that they're struggling with or things that could be improved in terms of processes, yeah, I wanted to make that change. It was also tough because sometimes when I bump into people that I actually know, they will see like, oh, like how bad did he mess up his life to be cleaning today and like washing dishes or like doing the trash. If I were to say like, oh yeah, this is my mom's company, I'm working. I feel that it's very snobbish. It discredits all the hard work that I put in. Being a servant doesn't mean that you're the lowest. In fact, it's a joy to serve people. Growing up without a dead, it made me somewhat insecure sometimes, but it was in church that I found my confidence. So I think growing up like that, it has also stuck with me that, yeah, I can find joy in serving people. I started to turn my coping mechanism to humor. So if people asked me, I know a boy, you know, I'm in the end you have to, I'll tell him, since I can't think who has a task, whatever puts food on the society. You're doing something that not many people want to do. It just so happens that for me it's cleaning and it might not be the most glamorous but yeah it's still a form of serving people. They're always just in the background, but they are the invisible force that keeps your everyday life running. So I just hope that next time anyone sees a younger person cleaning, it's not because they messed up their life, but it is still an honest job. It is one food on the table for my sister and I growing up. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
