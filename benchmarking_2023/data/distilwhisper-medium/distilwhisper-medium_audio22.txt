 Although the cemetery is a bit scary anything can happen inside no one know but then to me it's very peaceful you work alone you have your own time to do your stuff that's the greatest thing to me, la. is a chorchukang cemetery. I lay flowers to the grave. Usually during this time business in the cemetery, it's a bit busy., due to COVID-19, they asked us to shut down. No visitor are allowed to visit. So I came out with this idea to do it online. I will go down to the grave and lay flowers, do minor cleaning. I will send pictures before and after. I will send pictures, it's a bit tiring, la. Work alone in cemetery, yeah. To tell you the truth, actually, I am a scary cat. First thing, a bit scary, then I think back why I need to be scared. I know one day I'm going to be there also. So I change my mentality up to today, I enjoy. There's a few heartwarming, one of it. Her late mom just passed away. And she also cannot visit because she is in Australia. After I lay flowers, she called me again. She cried over the phone and she said, I'm very blessed to know that you, I'm doing this. To me, very, very touching. Because to touch someone's heart, right? It's very, very difficult. It's not about the money, in a way I'm just helping the community. Before this I'm a safety coordinator. I have been working in that industry for more than four years. My job also get affected due to the COVID-19, so I was affected very very badly so I don't know where to get income. I don't have very good education I drop out halfway during my I T E days so I told myself this is not a reason to stop me from being successful. My third person I don't like to give up easily. Example, like COVID-19 cannot physically sell flowers. If that's the case, right, we find other quantity. We stay online. Every close path, there's always an open park. So never, never give up. You're not.
