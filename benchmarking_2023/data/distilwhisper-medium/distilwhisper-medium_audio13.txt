 We have people who come in and give $2 for a buffet meal, but we also have people who come in and give $50 just for those. I don't think it really matters how much everyone gives because at the end of the day if that's all they can afford that's all they can afford we always make enough for us to open the next day and continue serving people. My name is Harris. I'm full-time employee at Anluch Mee. Anlichmee is an Indian Vegetarian restaurant that functions on a philosophy of Attiti Devo Baba or guest is God. So if tomorrow God were to come to your house and have a meal, you wouldn't give God a bill at the end of the day. A lot of people, the first that comes to mind is it's free food, but we simply do not price our food. We just want to provide home-style food to anyone without them having to worry about the money. Initially when I first started of volunteering here it would would really make me very, very angry and very upset to see people giving $5 for a meal or even $2 or even $1. I remember this once. This guy gave the very small amount for his meal and a few days later this guy comes back and he said I like to give back what I owe. It was at that point I really thought to myself you know it was so easy for me to judge the person without really understanding what was going on in their own personal lives I realize it's not my job to question how much people give. Instead, my job is very simple. My job is just serve good quality food and the money will come when it needs to come. Because you need the tose it to actually stick a little bit and then after it releases. I've been making tosees now ever since I started in 2016. For lunchtime you can see me behind the Dosa Tower making Dosa's. Yes, this is the game. There are no tricks. It's not like a tepen yaki bar or something like that. Instead being at the life station helps me communicate with people and sometimes I find a lot of people Indians especially giving a lot of wrong information to people who don't know much for Tose. So for example we have a special type of to say called the Jafna to say. When people see yellow color they're like oh it must be a pestret or an ad day which are actually two different styles of toces. They don't even use rice in them. So I'm always happy to stand there and correct them. All the time, people always asking me what I'm doing with my life and why am I working in a restaurant but I always knew I wanted to help people so I guess coming to unluksme and serving people this way has just been the right fit for me. At the end of the day there's nothing more important in life than your own peace of mind and your own mental and personal happiness. My grandmother and grandfather were one of the first few volunteers to come in. Seeing my grandparents come here and effortlessly serve for nearly 30 years. I kind of caught that spirit I guess. When Unilechmy first began it was a group of grandmothers and mothers who came together to help provide the recipes and to cook. When people come here and have a meal, it feels like they're being fed by a loved one. There's something really beautiful in being able to give back without expecting anything in return to serve someone good food and then they look at you and say thank you so much. I've been away from home for so long, but today you help me remember my mother. It's because the volunteers who come here are so involved, are so passionate that I don't think money has ever been a factor for not just me but for any of us who serve here in Anlukshmee. The
