You want to open up. I'm Prieman? Are you the king of pilots? I'm not to clean of toilets. So what are you? Well I'm a R&D manager overseeing all the designs for different fittings in the toilet all the way to manufacturing. This is not my favorite seat but this seems very comfortable. How you call ziepping? So every shopping center I would like to visit the toilet and then I'll see how the product performs. I'm looking at one thing, wow. Very interesting, there I will stay there and watch. But people when they pass back, I'll just, pay-day, just walk what, I'll now. I have a surprise for you. What you want me to do? Like that.

Well in the past manufacturing sector you manufacture a lot about there's not much technology being put in. Nowadays where we're talking about smart nations in Singapore especially, we have to apply a lot of technologies. That's why you see a lot of young engineers like to join Riggles just because they are being excited by all these technologies and they really want to apply the skill sets into developing new products. Since you are in the toilet business, right, so Rigg it's a company that gives a lot of toilet breaks on. So you can spend the whole day inside of toilet. Nobody will complain. The
