 I'm waiting for my girlfriend-founders of our coffee. Hi, my name is S.A.L.A.H.U.D.D.I.N. I do service and prepare food, drinks and cashiering as well. If customer come in, how you come and give them. So customer will write and point at a menu and I'll write with PAD, your T- Your team schedule you. It'll be. Wow, Dean is there. We also have James, the autism and Joshua with Mal intellectual disability. If there's no Dean, they will take a longer time to do things. Here's the one that would push them to do faster and to meet timing. For YouTube, I learned the alphabet. The other stuff is either he or Pauline teach, But we will make you feel very, very angry. It's one of the things in the cafe which they forgot how to do and then you just be more patient to teach them again repeatedly. Sometimes people with special needs to be get anxious easily because of sudden changes in environment or if you try to troll them in an unexpected situation. So that's the thing with working with my survivors. They are very very patient people and they also need to come in and tell them they have to share with me and not just to quiet with themselves. They also didn't want me to worry about it. He put me quite a few skills. I think skills are using the knife. It's a very kind and caring person. And then also very encouraging. For you who worry, you cannot find a job.. To find drop. With death. So you share with your family that you are the supervisor at India, surprise. What make you feel happy for gaming here? The staff, the customers and had the way. I think that's part of the job that we all want to do. We got lots of disabilities. you
