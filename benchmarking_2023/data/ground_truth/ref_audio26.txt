then when they were done they open the door i'm like hey hi i'm sam hi i'm hafeez hello i'm chow hi I'm leah and this is zula chickchats what is that it's a chick hi guys welcome to this episode of chick chats and in today's episode we're going to be talking about staying in hall in university so which uni were you from and which hall were you guys from i was from n t u and hall twelve i was from n t u also from the best hall hall 16 wow wow wow competitive i was in n u s i am in n u s and i lived in k r and n house so for me i stayed in residential college so it's somewhat like a hall but it's in u town they have their own programme i stayed in tembusu yeah that's where all the nerds are at mm fair eh but the nerds are cool the nerds are real cool so moving on let's talk about your own personal hall experience so what are the rooms you stay in and also like do you have any like stories to share about like roomates or like horror stories in hall uh i stayed in a double room so for n t u i is good cause you can actually choose your roomie before you go in so thankfully i chose like my friend and we are still friends ah that's because having a roommate right your dynamic with them completely changes ya it's test the friendship there are stories of people who like stop being friends with their roomie for my first two years i stayed with a roommate and then uh in my remaining time in hall i stayed in a single room so you like single or double better i enjoyed staying at the double room because i always have a roommate and it didn't get very lonely lah on the other hand a single room is great also because like things can go my way easier like in terms of the clean up in terms of uh access to my room access to my room ya so you know you know ya feel like there's some hidden message behind all these i live in kent ridge for one year year one sem two and year two sem one and then when i did noc that was year two sem two that was when i stayed in pgp i live in a single room because they only have single room and then in the evening when the sun shine through my windows wah so nice sia i live there i super nice and then i had all these fake flowers mm i stuck them around my bed frame so like it was just the dreamiest room i ever had i think for me i had the best of both worlds like which is a single room but also having the company of other people because i stay in a suite that has like a shared common area but you cannot choose your suite mates ya so you just heng suay whether you get good roommates or not for my first year the roommates i stay with were all seniors so we were just like hi bye but i was very very lucky when i was year two all people that i could click with so they are still my closest friends until now and then like two of them were exchange students who i still keep in contact with do you have any uh juicy roommate gossip stories to share i know of this couple that always appears in my friend's i g story 7pm or something they will be outside the door so they’ll always like make our for like i think a good five minutes before they go in to the room oh no but actually building on that right it's like the seeing into other people okay so rc is like the building are built all very near other like hdbs right so if you're on the top floor of this rc you can look down into the lower floor of another rc people don't realise that and then they leave their blinds open so my friend one time she's like guys i looked out my window i just saw this a couple having sex i was like what and then she's like everybody's talking about it in the chat and it's damn bad cause like how did you tell them also what right guys just be aware and close your blinds maybe it's a very important rule i didn't see anything with my own eyes but that's what i heard i think the walls are quite thin ah mm so when people study too hard you know sometimes it can be heard lah what then when they study wah this thing damn hard damn hard damn hard i get what you mean by thin wall it was my friend's room i walked past her door and then i heard like oh my god then i put my ears then i i stood with my door open then i lean against the door frame like that wait for them how long did you wait this girl damn creepy ah then when they were done they open the door i'm like hey they just laugh at me and tell me to go away lor so moving on to hall activities what are some of activities that you guys participated in so the way it works in halls at least for n u s is that if you want to stay on you need to accumulate points and to accumulate points you need to participate in events functions run by either your block or your hall so i didn't join anything i'm not particularly proud about it because i feel like hall is a great way to pick up new things and new skills Which i didn't get to experience for myself cause i was very busy working beyond school so i couldn't really accumulate points but because i spend a lot of time with my blockmate uh they helped me to stay on for the next semester so i think for rc we have the same things but we call them like interest groups at least in tembusu one of the groups that i think my friend started was t freedom which is the l g b t q plus uh group that support a lot of the l g b t q plus people in the hall itself in tembusu itself that's something that i feel makes tembusu a little bit different ya in terms of like what we offer i spend a lot of time in n u s dance so like the club the n u s club itself the biggest thing that i did was to take part in hall dance at the start of the year there will be a dance competition where all halls will compete together so that was really fun and also i think hall is a very good place actually to try something we never tried before like in terms of uh commitments and roles i joined as a group leader for orientation camp i was also in the hall community something i like about ntu we have this thing called ihg there are like a lot of different kind of sports and like recreational activities what is your biggest culture shock when you entered hall for hall there's like a shared pantry right and then that's where you realise some people are super gross have microwave oven and there are stories of people who use the oven as like to dry the socks so pro tip if you stay in the older halls please don't use the microave oven sometime even the urinal it's quite high right sometime it's like I don’t know how it got there i think the biggest culture shock for me right was the partying culture especially at the start of the semester then they are just always like you want to go out drinks you want to drink in my room even though it is strictly banned and people get into so much troubles and they started to clamp down very strongly towards the end of my hall stay lah ya oh also the sex culture so i heard of how there are whatsapp chats in hall that are just for hookups it's a rumour nobody has actually seen the chat oh you have anyways okay i i have not seen the chat you know little birdies that have told us about these things these things don’t give in to peer pressure if people around you are doing things that you don't believe in don’t do it just be your own person i don't know about n t u but i know like in n u s like if something happens ah wah the whole hall know about it like the next day that kind of thing just be aware of like your actions lor ya what is your biggest takeaway from staying in hall i think although there's a lot of like weird stories about hall and weird things that's going on i still really enjoyed my stay cause it really gave me a chance to like learn how to live on my own and another big takeaway is definitely the friends that i've made cause they are people who have seen you at your worst they are people who you can just definitely knock at the door uh and then go inside to talk if you feel down or anything i think the biggest takeaway for me will also be my friends these are the people who have been there for you lah because they are so accessible at the same time they are also very like i would say very like minded lah in a way independence is one of the biggest takeaways that you're gonna get cause for the first time in my life i had a place to call my own and everything that was within this little space right belongs to me and it felt so good it inspired me to want to work towards that again to some day be able to look at the place and say that i own this place the biggest takeaway from me and is that staying in rc or even hall right made my whole uni experience a lot easier ya because i had something to go back to all the time after like a very long day of classes and like friends who can uh kind of empathise with what i'm going to and also secondly i think is a lot about taking initiative and learning how to like start up your own project and lead your own project in hall ya because a lot of times you don't have the opportunity to do that outside so last question will be uh any advice to the fellow people who are entering hall in august i think anything like what you mentioned before stay true to yourself but i think still go inside with a very open mind cause there's a lot of new experiences you are going to enter into there's lot of new things you can try new things you can make so i think it's gonna be a very exciting time nonetheless lah i completely agree with whatever she has said remember to have fun also you know ya because like some people they just go they just like have hall to just study or like there's a place for them to rest after school and what not but they sometimes forget about the fun aspect of uni life while you’re having fun i feel like the fun element can people might over emphasise on that sometimes as well so like those who get very into all the activities and it might become very overwhelming for you and just find your support system know who you can rely on and who you can talk through all your struggles with and it will help you a lot through your new journey think my uh biggest advice is prioritise your time because that's something a lot of people don't realise so you know that whole triangle everyone like you want to study and social life then people always choose to study and social life and then they don't like get enough time for themselves i think that is something very important don't lose yourself in hall prioritising your own mental health is uh key to having a great life right ya today we talked about hall culture and we learnt that as long as you stay truth to yourself you're gonna enjoy everything and your new experience so if you guys like this video remember to leave a comment down below and also
