madam the first amendment is to implement the recommendation by the c p f advisory panel to allow members who turn fifty five in twenty thirteen or later to make a lump sum withdrawal of up to twenty percent from their retirement account when they reach the payout eligibility age for p e a in short with this change members will have three options on their lump sum withdrawals first withdraw the lump sum starting from their p e a birthday second defer withdrawing the lump sum beyond their payout start date for c p f life or the retirement sum scheme by transferring this lump sum to the ordinary account third convert the lump sum into monthly payouts through c p f life or the retirement sum scheme the second amendment simplifies the activation of c p f payout for members on the retirement sum scheme today members who joined the c p f life scheme will receive payout automatically when they reach age seventy however members on the retirement sum scheme have to apply to start their payout some of them may not have done so despite receiving reminders from c p f board around two months before their p e a we are therefore amending the c p f act to allow for automatic starting of payout at age seventy for members of the retirement sum scheme this approach is similar to that for c p f life it will start in twenty eighteen about one in three members are expected to benefit from the automatic starting of payouts under the retirement sum scheme the third set of amendments updates the c p f act to support the implementation of the basic healthcare sum b h s for short which stood effect on first of january twenty sixteen the b h s was introduced by the ministry of health for c p f members to meet their basic subsidised healthcare needs in old age the b h s is fixed for each cohort when they turn sixty five years old it's a maximum amount a member can set aside in his medisave account any additional medisave contributions above the b h s are transferred to the member’s special or retirement accounts to increase his retirement income in addition members aged fifty five and above now no longer need to top up their medisave account before withdrawing from their ordinary and special accounts to fully effect these changes we are amending the c p f act to remove obsolete provisions relating to the medisave minimum sum scheme minimum sum and fix a b h s for each cohort when they turn sixty five years old the fourth and last set of amendments provide greater clarity and efficiency in the administration of some parts of the c p f system and this include replacing minimum sum with retirement sum clarifying administrative financial penalties framework recovery of government grants and other payments make an error and catering for members whose birthday fall on twenty nine february i would provide just one example on simplifying the medisave top up process for family members today members age fifty five and above who've already set aside their cohort full retirement sum have to withdraw the excess monies from their ordinary and special accounts in cash before they can use it to top up the medisave account of certain family members age fifty five and above so this amendment will enable members to make such top up directly from their ordinary and special accounts to the medisave accounts of these family members
