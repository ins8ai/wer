for my partner and i to make our living room what we considered cozy and our bedroom like what we considered cosy it’s very nice like before going to bed i used to look at her now i now i look at the corner that i decorate but i look at her in the morning lah okay okay okay yeah okay and we are back for another episode of tea talks and we are here to talk about housing cause we are all our first time house owners okay maybe you all can say your um type of housing you know maybe your marital status that kind of stuff so my name is pei fang and then um i am 28 this year attached not married yet i i am getting a flat in jurong east in 5 years time in 2028 i'm ben i'm 32 this year i'm married and i have a resale flat in punggol yeah i just moved in like two months ago mm mm um bella 35 i stay in a private condo um it's a studio apartment so it’s pretty small swimming pool got swimming pool yay hi my name is yu heng uh i'm 30 this year i'm recently engaged my b t o is in tampines yeah yay tampines yay tampines yea like suddenly sileny no one cheer for him eh okay I cheer for myself yay tampines okay so we're gonna play this game called like would you rather lah so there are certain like options here so would you rather a spend less for a less ideal location or would you b pay more for an ideal location so who is a yay it’s the westies maybe they did really spend less compared to us okay so you all say you all pay less for less ideal location so what do you all forgo in your choice uh not choosing tiong bahru over jurong east oh ya i was like at the top of my head before seeing like the price i was like tiong bahru cause like the tiong bahru curry rice to eat if the stall move you also move no but there's just like a greater proportion of like good food in that area ya and then the estate got also looks very like um nice and all like very chill vibes that kind of thing but um my situation is not ideal in a sense that i don't um earn that much for me to afford that location so i need to like prioritise on whatever i can afford lah so i decided to go for like jurong east cause i think jurong east is like there's a lot of like shopping malls and like a lot of amenities there also for you leh was location a issue an issue so actually my location is quite ideal already because uh i think when my partner and i were discussing right we kind of wanted either bedok or tampines we like tampines lah but we forgo a lot of things for us because we weren't expecting to get a flat during the exercise but we did and when when it was our turn to choose a flat we didn't have high floor options left so i mean as much as we wanted to also stay like thirty floor that kind right we don't have a choice lah so that's one thing that we have to forgo ya lor those are the things that unfortunately i can't choose but my price is quite healthy lah for me to think about so i don't feel anxious thinking oh my goodness i need to pay so much ya i think for me location is one of the primary consideration your location cost how much mm okay not punggol per se but like like within the estate i wanted something that was more accessible and had like facilities or amenities nearby what's important for you i think commute to work for one yeah i think that was the main thing that my partner and i were looking at mm mm mm yeah pei fang face like that cause commute to work is further but I mean that’s where you save on costs then you also stay near your parents correct yeah so i stayed within just nice within the 4km radius so i managed to get the proximity housing grant as well ya so i think i was just like within 100 metres if i throw a stone already the stone won't get the grant okay so since you all say you all will pay less for a less ideal location i want to know like how much did your house cost like roughly mine was about 320k for four room flat nice nice that's a good number ya it’s enough uh around it's similar to your cost um 370 plus okay okay i'm quite envious when i hear all the bto prices so mine is resale right so i paid about close to half a million there about for a four room no but then you get your flat faster also ya I mean you move in already but they are still waiting we are still waiting you know you we just see the like the model the paper the floor plsn then put on igs five years later see you that kind wah i don't think i can eh to like commit that and like you just see the model i don't know when you think about the cost you can commit already thanks so so what about the cost for you okay so ya lah I hear 300 Hear 500 then like i damn sian lah am i stupid for doing this because you all have partners then i bought this like as a single uh so my place for studio apartment which is like damn tiny is uh 700 700k when i hear all of your amounts it's like oh my god it's like more than double of i can buy two btos two four room flat wait but where is it eunos  i think i should make more friends in the east alright you can move here change your b t o no no no then i'll invite you all to the west also i think people won't go but okay you can try ok let me know in five years i put it on my calendar oh ya my house warming if we are still friends in five years time okay would you rather a buy a resale flat or private property to move in earlier or b buy a b t o and move in later sorry i need to read the paper i'm speaking properly and you cannot register okay who is a i'm half half eh i cannot ya why half half i mean clearly i bought a resale because i wanted the convenience of being able to move in right now right but at the same time i see the benefits of having a bto whereby you get something at the subsidised rate ya you you do have to wait but it saves you a lot of money in the long run as well my spouse and i we've been renting for a couple of years already so we are very used to having our own space you know i i love living with my parents and i and i appreciate them for for all that but i also really like having my space so i don't think it's something that i can go back to so i think we would still go for resale actually i think that's quite a great point eh because a lot of uh couples want that freedom also like for us for me and my partner sometimes we will we will just like randomly check for things and we will think about how nice it is if we had our own space like now right yeah yeah okay the situation around me getting my bto was that it was a decision that we we didn't expect to make because it wasn't a very ideal unit lah for her and she really like the dream home she envisioned wasn't like facing a carpark on the fourth floor yeah so why did your partner decide to keep the flat okay so after discussing for for months right i think one fine day she just woke up and she's like you know what let's just try to make this home the best home we can then if even if we don't like it down the road if like she cannot stand like you know the car park noises or whatever we will just find a new place to live lah like it's not like we have to commit to something at this point of life it's the idea that you make your dream home not that the dream home is given to you so pei fang would you rent before you get your bto i haven't really thought of that question leh so like just now when you all talking about it i was like thinking at the back of my head like wah should i rent or not cause a lot of people have ask me also and they are like five years you will be like 30 30 plus like in in that time already then how to start a family blah blah blah that kind of thing you're too old for that then i'm like I'm like thanks for the reminder like i know it or like i don't know like maybe an alternative is to similar to um yu heng’s case is my boyfriend will just come over and like live with me i mean i haven't like brought up that topic and all cause um it's not something that we are considering at that moment ah mm he also haven't proposed yet ya lor right how can where's your proposal where's your proposal okay i haven't even like talk to him like so i think for bella um she mentioned just now that she needs to pay 700k right like in a lump not not really a lump sum ya still don't have the 700k but ya ya correct so for us like at least we get like the the e h g grant enhanced housing grant so basically is a grant given by uh h d b for you to offset some of the cost of financing your house lah i mean your house cost like 700k right so how do you afford it i can't afford it sometimes i wonder too no lah i think it's a commitment that you you decided on right so there will be certain life changes ah like previously i always thought of you know every few years i will live a year overseas um but now with a house then you have to ask yourself you know can you afford it or like i must always have a job but definitely like having such a big financial commitment is is huge lah then just gonna make adjustments to my lifestyle lor i cancelled disney plus subscription no lah just really just take note of like every single month like now i have a table of like all my expenditure and all the loans i have to pay and then i feel like a lot of people don't i mean the people i know at least right didn't think about that until they committed to a housing option like for example they will be like oh ya i can afford it but then when they go for the housing option that they want then they realise oh now i have to like change a lot to my life if you haven't gotten a house it it's a good idea to start thinking about all these things first lah i wish i thought about that more you’re a planner no no she she's a my partner is a planner i wasn't ya because if she didn't kick start the whole process of like let's plan of finances right i would have been a lot more anxious about my house so the idea that that you know we have to sit down and think about okay if we want to afford this what should our life look like uh what should our lifestyle be like okay are you ready for the last one yes this one looks very long so pei fang should slowly digest and tell us i digest first ah would you rather a buy your dream house as your first home and stay there in the long run or b buy a this handwriting a bit ugly but or b buy a starter home and upgrade at a later time wah starter home like minecraft eh ya sia i think this is a a for me at the moment okay you buy your dream house and stay in the long run as in my current situation is a a for me okay but is that what you would have chose i thought your dream house is tiong bahru please that’s dream  a one then this is dream a2 so still dream house still can consider dream house lah yeah happy for you yeah yeah yeah i mean their okay tiong bahru is dream a one because of the location yeah location is ideal yeah yeah but jurong east is a2 because um the location is not as ideal as tiong bahru but the height is great yes it's great yes so it's still considered dream okay that's my definition so so why then why why did why were you all like this is starter and i mean cost is a big thing lah obviously like for example her dream home like i said it's a condo right but given our current finances it's a bit hard for us to look at a condo and be like i want to buy it then your dream home my dream home is as long as it's nice and it has a very nice kitchen i'm happy with it but unfortunately that also means that a lot of condos right because their kitchen is very small right ya so we do have to like weigh our pros and cons lah yeah but happy wife happy life she want condo actually you should have said for you my home is where my babe is that's home correct my dream home is where my where my wife is where my future wife is trying to be boyfriend of the year i cannot take it and i think the bonus of having a bto that a lot of people don't necessarily think about is the fact that like waiting isn't bad thing waiting means that you have time to build up your finances you have time to to progress in your career to a more stable place so that when you actually get the house you don't feel anxious about a lot of things okay or ben you just recently moved in so was it very exciting like seeing everything done up like how you planned it to be yes like it's nice to be able to finally decorate and like make something your own or like you know everyone has a different idea of cozy so for us like for my partner and i to make our living room what we consider cozy and our bedroom like what we considered cozy is very nice like like before going to bed i used to look at her now i now i look at the corner that I but i look at her in the morning so as first time house owners like what are you all most excited about I want to hear pei fang’s one but I need to think I haven't really think about it I think I’m also excited to host my first house party eh I'm very excited also about that see this what you’re excited about ah not the decorating No that one then after that when it’s so nice already right then you invite people to your house then you are like wah look at people's house yeah because I've been going to a lot of house parties ya I think’s its having that space to yourself to be able to like invite people over and i don't know create memories in that house good vibes good vibes ya but it's nice to have friends over that true ben havent invited us just saying when’s your house he said he just moved in only still got all the cupboard boxes so take some time give him some time oh yeah correct sorry you have been busy ya so i think like a lot of people definitely would want to get some advice if they can you know on the whole process of being a first time house owner so what's the most important advice that you all will actually give to people who are looking to get their first place i think being a first time home owner can be quite daunting to a lot of people and sometimes in the process of getting the house you might feel like you know you never get what you want what's more important is that as long as you learn how to manage the good to have versus the must have right you will still eventually get a nice place lah a place that you can call your own yeah actually the ideal home that you have in your head is really just a concept right at the end of the day yeah it's like if you fulfill your must haves then i think it's good enough yeah it can be your starter home yeah the ideal home is just a place for us to host house parties i i just want to add on also like everyone have different opinions about like what an ideal home is right like for example we have three easties and one westies right then every time i kena this like my house is like huh why the west sound very good meh the location then at the end of the day like i'll be like uh no i i i like my current home like it is the i it is like a pretty good location for me and like there are a lot of like good things that come along with it then i'll be just like mm i'm happy alone you all can say whatever you all want i'll leave that to five years later you all make your own decision from there i'm quite convinced lah i'm very curious about the west Later we all go there yeah with very high expectations yeah I won’t the west won't disappoint you all i hope it has been great like listening to the experience of like different types of home owners ya if you have any questions you can leave it in the comment section and i hope you enjoy this episode thank you thank you bye
