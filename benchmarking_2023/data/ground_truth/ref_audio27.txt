i don't know how to display our own signs of aggression maybe we take out a textbook read in your faces hi I'm hafeez hi I'm gab hi i'm bry hi i'm leah and this is so today's episode of chick chats we will be talking about boys' school culture okay before we start please tell us which school you guys are from okay so i was from uh raffles institution from sec one to sec four so that was my my ball boy ball balls but it was my boy's school period i was from st michaels primary school now known as saint joseph's junior then after that i went on to normal sji i went to saint stephen's for primary school and then i went to uh saint pats otherwise known as sain patrick school for six uh four years in secondary school yeah no problem i I was not from a boys school but i was from c h i j talking about the experiences that you guys had uh going to a boys school uh hafeez maybe you can start off with you you know why because you came from uh a co ed school first and then you went into a boys school so how was that like for you okay for me like it was quite a game changer because back in my school i was I was still very shy i remember some girls like used to bully me last time ah ya legit so i was eating food and then they took my fork and they ran away i couldn’t eat so when i went to secondary school it was all boys then like i didn't have girls to like disturb me or like bully me okay raffles like to be honest when you think of it like you will think like wah you just be like a bunch of nerds or like people who just gonna study but ya like the friends that i mix with were mostly quite rowdy lah then like ya maybe that's why i'm like this now but but it was an interesting change are you guys is it similar experience like the school very like the boys school very rowdy one because this is what i think of we will get up to a lot of nonsense lah like you know like play prank on teacher each other uh we fight uh like you go through like the high and lows altogether ya uh so i don't know if it's like a thing for mixed schools where there are girls but as in for an all boys' school we used to get like public caning everyday like not everybody lah like those that misbehave one by one do you all have any cases of like bullying in school i was the bully okay okay lah i i didn't consider it bullying essentially it was just my group of friends we didn't bully anyone i don't know i think it's a big group thing i just like think this guy looks funny or something then i tell my friends guys you know this guy his his specs right his degree 1000 degree look like owl then everybody will rush to this person's class right it's bullying okay lah but i understand what you're trying say as in you just making fun that kind of thing but then technically speaking it is bullying lah yeah i think at that time when we were all like boys and childish we like didn't know better lor mm ya i think for me and my group of friends is very similar to what gab has just oh okay okay so it's just the dynamics of group lor when something funny happens or when someone says something funny then we were just like attack the person okay and the person can still be one of our friends is it very normal to have fights in my school mine is like everyday there was a fight so the most epic one right and this was like a police case oh my god there was this two friends so they were having a conversation during recess and then his friend apparently said that his girlfriend uh is very ugly so he got very angry and riled up that he took his fork and he story yes yes yes so he became known as like the fork stabber the friend had to go hospital then the friend went hospital right apparently he had like four dots so like word spread naturally then our principal told us doing uh like the assembly said uh if there are news reporters outside the school please don't talk to anybody but everyone spoke to the reporters oh my god do you all have like um crushes on the female teachers definitely yeah very normal for me okay especially because from all boys school right mm there are no females around except the teachers because i see these teachers all the time right and they carry themselves in certain way that makes me a little bit more attracted to characteristics like like that in other girls crushes i wouldn't say like a serious oh my god ma’am I love you sia oh my god you all call your teacher ma'am ya there was a guy i know you know how teachers when they talk then they will walk down the row then he put his elbow at the corner of the desk then when her butt like graced his elbow right then he then he hit puberty then she’s like uh sorry then then he was like oh sorry sorry but actually he was like did it intentionally actually it’s sexual harassment eh if you think about it so there was one time there was this uh relief teacher the class she had to relief was a very rowdy class and basically like they took off their shirt and they started doing this around her oh my god i'll be terrified eh if I was i don't know if like sexual harassment or what sia in that case i think like especially now if it's 2019 context right it’s definitely sexual harrassment aiya ten years ago it was still sexual harrassment it was still indecency not that it was overlooked ya it was i guess it was overlooked also lah so um is there any like ranking between like the boys school or do you all have a particular perceived notion of any other school do you like this school you don't like this school that kind of thing i think for me ah for for ri boys ah because like i think our top rivals will be catholic cat high boys okay because firstly we are within the same vicinity every time when we see cat high boy or what i don't know how we display like our own sign of aggression maybe we take out a textbook read in their faces or ya but it's like  something about cat high boys ah i think also because like they they don't have long pants and once we reach sec three then it' something that we will always like internally like disturb them about lah eh wah so hairy  still wear wear shorts kind of thing ya but it's all just like mindless banter among  ourselves sometimes when i see ri boys i think wah these people just take our uniform but then put our ri badge oh my god are you all same uniform oh my god all of you all have the same uniform what the  i think for saint pats right like we honestly did not give two shits about the academic ranking lah but for some reason i don't know why we always dislike sji ya like we always felt like sji was like the the nerdier uncool version of us secondary yeah eventually we outgrow that lah because after all we are like brothers school you mentioned something about like what the saint pats boys will go to don't know where to see the k c girls what was that you said ya so basically after school everyday right there were a few like hot spots where saint pats boys will go to to like look at uh sac girls or like kc  girls okay ya so we always will go to like siglap macs or parkway parade or like uh the marine parade that market area sji the nearest school to us like literally like 500 metres down is uh scgs what i've heard is that all some of the the younger boys used to walk over to scgs and they try but i think the scgs girls didn't give a damn about us most of the time if i'm not wrong it will be the s c g s the girl with the acs guys got date the r g s girls or not okay funny as it is uh the hot spot for me for my friends ah at least was bishan library like i think they got quite close to a group of r g s girls and crescent or cedar girls also ya so what they would do is have study sessions lah after school we move on to maybe talking about like some misconceptions or assumptions people have about boys school boys ya and then actually one of them uh was because i we did the episode on the girl's school culture right and then everybody's like oh all girls school girls are lesbians that kind of thing is it the opposite for guys they people have the assumption that all of you all are gay i think there's definitely like um a percentage in saint pats lah but we always used to make fun of sji of like being like the gayest school i don't know why maybe because of the stuff that we do together when we are in school we would strip someone down to his underwear in class right right after the class ends and then just leave him inside and lock the door no no but as in he’s our friends okay maybe that's why people call us gay lah we know we are not i think maybe it stems from like how close we are as like bros ya ya so like we stay over each other's house slap like each other ass one of the things that uh someone ask me to ask is that are boys school boys homophobic because people make all these type of comments i think in saint pats it's really quite jialat there was this guy who posted on his blog he went on a date with a guy from another school that was like a saturday or something when he posted then after that weekend he came back on a monday right everyone just started like shouting at him like eh gay gay then like people will throw tissue like people will throw like things at him then he just walked down the corridor but he wasn't like affected we knew who was gay but we didn't nobody bullyed them one of the girls ask me to ask you all do you all play soccer every recess I won't say every recess lah there are days where we have to really eat lah cause damn hungry right i wasn't one of the soccer clique ya another misconception right is that uh boys school boys are very rich my perception is that like all boys school for example like acs or saint andrew's are the rich ones okay ya then saint pats like no lah i think for ri maybe because like is the branding lor how do i put that the image of an r i boy that that they portray or they like to push out is someone who is very prim very proper so like might come across as uh coming from a rich family or wealthy background lah even though like there are people who are very rich and stuff but i think at the end of the day like they didn't really like use this to look down on other people i don't know why people say that because i don't know if about about now but back then there was this programme called uh something about welfare assisatance is for the the more underprivileged kids lah um no doubt i have to say that some of us come from an above average household even in school right they teach us to be independence of our parents especially in terms of like finances so as much as i came from a from an above average household right i was actually some some poor dog i was living like day to day on the $2 my mother give me maybe because we are an independent school the more wealthier parents yeah aremore willing to spend a little bit more money to send their child to like I guess an all girls or an all boys school people assume boys school boys are like very more elite i think it will be a lot from like the ri side also like because ri is also a very elite school i think at the end of the day it really boils down to who you are as a person like regardless of what school you come from and also like the kind of friends you mix with for me i i couldn't really experience any of these like uh pretentious nature or elitist mindset all the perceptions right are created by our parents generation then they just like yeah pass down so that's what we think looking back at your younger self do you have any advice for yourself or uh advice for people who are currently in a boys school don't take out your clothes kind of h my god i think for boys' school at least like sometimes you might get too carried away in terms of like having too much fun with your friends ya but i think you still have to take note of like how important like academics actually is also it’s not something that you can just like throw away lah but instead use your dynamics as the bros group to encourage each other or push each other then and that's great lah because really the influence that we have on one another i would say is very very strong it’s good to sit in the canteen for maybe an hour and just like just talk shit ah because this is how boys' school boys bond if i have kids in the future right i would still send them to like have saint pats or if it's a daughter i'll send them to ij lah mm ya cause i think the culture is very unique i think it's it's good to take away also lah that you know no matter what's going you go to it's like you need to work it's like you just work hard and like you know be yourself make good friends and that's great don't discriminate based on the school okay so with that said we concluded
