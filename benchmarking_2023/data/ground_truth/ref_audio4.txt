your bones are brittle you should not climb a lot of people will tell you at sixty seven is dangerous when i reach the top i have lots of claps and then they’ll then i'll tell them shhh almost every gym that i go they know i auntie dolly i don't mind that because i think auntie is a status of wisdom when i was in my early fifties and i was having a back problem she saw me doing stretching and then she say since you are stretching why don't you go and stretch on the wall she taught me the way to climb very fierce very fierce very fierce anything wrong only not that leg sometimes she said you’re like an elephant on the wall when i started i have height phobia i try not to look down i looked up i was worried like my mum might fall like scrape her wrist hit her head i think that was my worst fear but once she got up a certain height i'm like okay pay me one million dollars before i let you down but then if i don't finish you won't let me down ya when you reach the top you find that you have a accomplished something i learn to be more confident and till now i don't have back aches it also overcomes my height phobia right now any hanging bridge you give me no problem my first climb to outdoor was in taiwan you don't feel like you're climbing that high up you find that oh the scenery is so nice i was very fortunate i have good friends around that climbs with me so i brought my mum along now they go on holidays they go without me when i hang out or climb with her friends i don't think i am any older than them you can do it i can do it also ya one thing i learnt from auntie dolly is to have a towel on my harness and bedroom slippers when i climb so that my feet don't get dirty i think she become socially younger i know not many young ones thinks that the old ones are worth mixing with they find they are naggy but uh her friends are all very sweet they're always eager there to help you i may slowly slowly slow down but i will not give up in fact i climb with two senior climbers both are older than me it's a matter of you stepping out of your comfort zone only yeah i think anyone can climb i'm eighty and if i can climb anyone can climb she doesn't look to crush the hardest route but also to like support people when they climb she pushes boundary i'm proud of my mother it's the first time i hear from her that she looked up to me
