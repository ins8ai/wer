i find it quite therapeutic to clean dishes you have no cares in the world in hokkien we say lup sup jiak lup sup dua it's like you eat dirty you grow up dirty sometimes i ask what am i doing with my life when i first started get a dishwasher it's a real struggle i was very scared of the dirt and the filth ah mana sini ah okay thank you bang see the grime and the rotting food sometimes because of the smell it will make you like a gag cleaning is the bread and butter of my family my mum she actually has been in this line for quite a while now couple of decades in fact i really respect her a lot because she is a sole breadwinner she brought me and my sister up single handedly i was faced with the decision on whether i should go to uni or come into this dish washing line to help my mum but i realised that maybe you don't need a degree to wash dishes yeah i don't think she can keep going at this pace much longer so ya i guessed needed to step in to help alleviate this burden off her thank you my colleagues are all very old yeah they're like my ah ma's age eh It's just very wholesome i feel sometimes it's like i'm working with my ah ma like that technically like right but they would actually buy me meal sometimes it's like they see me as their own grandkid i feel like people can't respect you if you don't know how to do it if you want to manage something you have to learn the nature of it and the best way is by doing it and if they had anything that they're struggling with or uh things that could be improved in terms of processes ya i wanted to make that change it was also tough because sometimes when i bump into people that i actually know then they will see like oh like how bad did he mess up his life to be cleaning today like washing dishes or like clearning the trash if i were to say like oh yeah this is my mum's company uh i'm working i feel that it's very snobbish it discredits all the hardwork that i put in being a servant doesn't mean that you're the lowest yeah in fact is a joy to serve people growing up without dad made me somewhat insecure but it was in church that i found my confidence so i think growing up like that it they also stuck with me that yeah i can find joy in serving people i started to turn like my coping mechanism to humour so if people like ask me boy i'll tell them oh time are tough whatever puts food on the table got to keep dripping this is really an honest living and you serving the society that you're doing something that there are not many people wants to do just so happens that for me it's cleaning and might not be the most glamorous but ya it's still a form of serving people they're always just in the background but they are the invisible force that keeps your everyday life running so i just hope that next time anyone sees a younger person cleaning it's not because they mess up their lives it is still a honest job it was what put food on the table for my sister and I growing up
