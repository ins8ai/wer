i think being unwanted is a thing that i struggled with like my whole life your birth parents don't want you your adoptive parents aren't showing you enough love and attention so it feels like you are unwanted since birth and at home growing up i used to get into disagreement with my parents however as i grew older i learnt that parent child relationships are not easy to navigate on this episode of i speak to dewy who at two years old found out she was adopted by her parents okay the first question is how did you find out you were adopted i remember i was two years old then i was at the okay in my memory right i remember like a dining table i remember i was so short like the dining table was like over here then i was just sitting there and then like my grandma and my mum was in the midst of a conversation then like they talk about me being adopted then i was like huh wait I'm adopted then my mum was just kind of like ya but then i think it was only when i grew up i go school right then i realise eh actually everyone's mother is their real mother then i'm the only one with the what fake mother ah it's a very very weird feeling the thing is i still see her as my mother cause i still call her mummy and everything right but it's like when i see other people's parents do certain things for their kids if she don't do it right the thing that will come to my head will be oh is she not doing this because she's not my mum hell no because i know personally that some of them might not be able to like process it i don't want them to see me the way i saw my mum because one that once that thought registers right anytime my mum like treats me badly or anytime i feel a sense of unfairness right i'll redirect it to the fact that oh i'm adopted next one oh did you feel unwanted um of course man i think being unwanted is a thing that i struggled with like my whole life it's like in my head especially as a kid that was immature um your birth parents don't want you your adoptive parents aren't showing you enough love and attention so it feels like you're unwanted since birth and at home it always feels like i have to over compensate ya so i think that's the reason why i'm also like quite loud i feel like i have to be able to make people laugh i mean i love to make people laugh but like it sometimes also feels like i have to to you know have their sense of validation like hey okay i like this girl i want her to be my friend that kind of thing ya i remember i had this one girl uh friend that i was very close to at that point of time my mum came to pick her up and then their relationship was very like very close they were almost like best friends then i was like oh shit then i got very jealous i remember i cried in the car i feel like um your childhood will still always like how you say haunt you no matter what especially because like i really struggled with the whole adoption and being unwanted thing for like so long in my head i'll scold my birth parents it'll be like if you can't raise a kid don't give birth to me and like put me in this world with this bunch of stupid parents especially my mum right it's like if you don't even show me that you love me then like why are you scolding me treating me like that and that's why we had a very very bad relationship i felt really lonely i felt it was in secondary school right i told myself you know what i think i'm alone in this world and i think only i can get what i want i think that was like the main idea and feeling that i felt like throughout my teenage years if i start depending on people right uh i will feel like i'm losing control again i still struggle with it like everyday would you look for your biological parents i would say no now because i don't really have time for that cause like if i find them i don't know i don't know how i feel if i actually meet them i think it will be a mix of emotions but i feel like eventually as life go by i feel like it will be one of my life missions to really just meet who gave birth to me who made me like for example sometimes i can be very emotional sometimes i can be a bit too angry sometimes i'll ask myself do i get these traits from my birth parents so i've always wanted to like get them get to know them as a person right and see if there are any similarities between me and them and actually yeah actually now i think about it i would love to get to know them as a person and see how they are yeah i think the person that is angry right is not me eh it's the child that's inside of me but it's like if i think as present me who is a bit more mature as compared to back then right i don't feel angry i just feel curious but i can always feel this like anger inside of me like deep deep deep deep down i think it will be closure for the younger me who was so angry at her birth mum it will be closure for her i don't need closure i'm good but i think she does yeah what does family mean to you I feel like i'm on an episode of barney okay no one in my family is biologically related to each other my brother is adopted but then i think to me now family is i think it's just beyond blood lah i think that makes us more of a family actually if you really think about it there are families out there that are related but then they don't even treat each other like family i feel like pregnant ladies right they have nine months to register that okay they have a kid inside of there but my mum didn't have that it's just like here’s a kid take care of it love it discipline it and i think my mum is quite now i understand that she's super strong and amazing for being able to do that but then back then i didn't understand that i remember like one day i just got so drunk i drunk text my own mum i said mummy i'm so sorry i was so ungrateful i should have been more grateful and i realised that if i start being grateful right maybe i'll be happier and it worked right now i feel like when i think about my future it always involves my parents and my family like last time it was really selfish it was just me and my future but eventually i hope i'll be rich enough right so my father can retire because i always feel that my father work very very hard like i want him to be able to retire at the age where he can still go out go play golf he can still enjoy life with my mum yeah that's the dream yeah would you adopt children in the future yes a big yes i i love kids that's one and i i still think that adoption is as beautiful a thing as pregnancy is but then i i think i will try to conceive first um if i give birth right the kid will be the first person i know or i have met that is like biologically related to me yeah i think i'll feel like i'm not alone anymore and i think it will be the best feeling in the world cause like the younger me would say i finally have a family is there anything you would like to tell your adoptive parents um oh shit give me a moment thank you for giving me life ya thank you for giving me a chance to like giving me the chance to live life and giving me the potential to be great at life I think even though like we went through a lot i think it really made me the person i am today i mean yup there are things that they could have certainly done better for sure but no one taught them to be parents and i think that they really did their best so ya i think i owe it to them for bringing me up and people can give birth to kids but to raise a kid right i think it's hard yeah there are more orphans than there are parents which says a lot yeah because not everyone can be a parent i hope you enjoyed this episode of i hope that this allow you to reflect on your own relationship with your parents as well if you enjoyed this video
