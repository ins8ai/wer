people ask me a lot why don't i just go and become like this super high paid lawyer and then donate a lot of money to refugees it's not like my dream was always to be a hawker to sell coffee at the hawker centre i didn't even drink coffee the only reason i did this was to create livelihood for refugees in thailand mm usually i have to get to the depot shop by around seven plus seven thirty latest i got to pick up all the ingredients that amoy needs for the day like their bread their coffee beans and load it up into the car and then drive it off to amoy if i see like this on the way i'll be like oh today slow then you'll wonder like if there will be any customer at all that kind of thing okay hello this is our logo for every cup that you drink your coffee fifty cents is going to the refugee who did the artwork on this cup it is actually just black and white when it's printed in thailand then it sent directly to these refugees who are we are working with they colour in every single one of our cup will be unique because it's actually coloured by someone different we try to commission enough stickers every month so three hundred stickers every month works out to three thousand baht and that is the average price of rent in outer bangkok actually before i started Mad Roaster i didn't even drink coffee like i was a lawyer and all of my lawyer friends who pull all nighters they will drink coffee right i'm hoping that mad roaster creates like a machine that converts the existing consumerism in singapore into meaningful livelihoods for refugees i don't want it to always just be aid and donations that are sustaining them no one wants to queue up for three hours one wants to go there and have to prove how poor thing they are to get the bag of rice why can't they just get a bag of rice themselves there’s dignity in earning your own living and being able to look after your family yourself Ah thank you so much people ask me like why refugees specifically right i think there was a time in my life where i really needed help and i needed someone to speak up for me and to like fight for me because i was too weak to do it for myself at that period of time i also heard a lot about refugees it resonated a lot of me lah what they are going through because no one will believe their story no one will help them and that's why i want to help i realised that for a lot of them they don't have the legal right to work the more pressing need was pay rent or buy food for their children and i felt that it would be more useful for me to focus my attention on livelihoods and that's how i ended up with mad roaster everything okay ah i go back first bye bye Brioche making process is very long actually we take around six to eight hours i mean sometimes i'll think about it like maybe you just buy from like wholesaler you know like delifrance then you just be like second seller but i think it will affect cause we're already known for all these stuff so can't really change the menu now and people will realise nothing sorry got no customer for y’all to film like for me i'm more of a worrier but i think my dad not so much so he will just be like oh there seasons whereas for me i will like stressed at every like whenever it's down i'll just be like oh my gosh no eh thanks ah my normal life last time every lunch i will go to the gym which cost me like i think maybe two hundred a month right after my gym i'll go and buy this seven dollar chai latte and i want to be like walao this seven bucks this is crazy but i will still do it every single day yeah sometimes people ask me if i miss my old job right i do miss being an employee if anyone is an employee stay an employee don't become my employer uh because i've never experienced living so close to the margin before right mentally you're under a lot more uncertainty and that feeling of not knowing you can cover this mental stress is what the refugees that i work with go through every day of their life i think one of the reasons that i continued even though it's a pretty hard time was okay we're supporting eleven refugees if i have to feel like this everyday this like mental stress i can imagine eleven people have to feel like that without our programmes the only reason i'm still here is because i feel like there's a bigger purpose to this shop the more cups we sell the more refugees we can on board to our programme every cup matters every cup is literally like someone is behind the artwork on your cup and it's their life that you are like helping out
