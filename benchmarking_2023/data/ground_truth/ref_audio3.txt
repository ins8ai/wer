when i was at my peak i spent most whatever i earn i got nice clothing i own couple of luxury watches during the lowest point of my life i was homeless and i i never tell anyone you know because i was very embarrassed i stay in east coast for a couple of days then i go to changi but i was thinking a question to myself you know what can i do get myself out of this See some people they are very good with maths yeah i'm not good with maths but i'm good at day dreaming that's my biggest talent day dreaming I do a lot of creative work that i like to travel yeah and i like images i shoot everything you know i go to bus stop public area i just shoot randomly i learn aesthetic from there i don't go to film school but i got lucky lah yeah in a way right because i meet the right people so i met this japanese boss ah Mori he set me right to japanese construction in singapore at that point right i get quite good income it's hard to penetrate you know japanese construction i've never see this kind of amount of money before you know financially lah i'm not taught how to save money my circle of friends ah they come from money lah yeah so they go party they have nice cars and so on i was influenced by my surroundings then i got to watches like omega rolex at one point i was feeling a good life lah so-called but uh life is not a bed of roses after eight years Mori pass on ah things get bad then covid started right uh everything disrupted especially the construction area i was a freelancer about a year plus ah project getting lesser and lesser so i don't have enough income that time i sold everything you know i don't have any camera i have just enough money to buy a tent then uh with me right uh just a small little bag remember one time i called my mum so my mum ask me eh where are you how are you i said i'm good I'm at my friend place thinking maybe eh my son is doing quite good you know you're somewhere because i seldom see my mum i feel like i'm let down that point ah i was really very hungry and people next to me they are barbecuing that is the saddest part of my life one day uh i feel a pain in my ear when i close my eyes i can see red blue purple you know so i didn't know actually something is happening inside my my head i was warded so i was diagnosed with uh stroke due to my condition it was uh very hard for me to apply for a job when i was hospitalised uh i met this uh social worker uh connected me to Noel my first impression i thought he's a young man yeah because uh when he spoke to me ah he sounds very jovial energetic he tell me that not to worry because he's there to guide me and help me revamp my resume yeah because outdated lah Rafie in terms of his personality he's a fighter he's a survivor lah so he went to do grab uh he went to take on part time jobs that comes his way so this is something that i really admire him when he shared with me his situation i was able to empathise with him and i guess that also helped him to move on because he had a listening ear and from there he can work towards getting employment most of my life uh i'm alone i'm on my own you know it's like i a heaven sent when noel called me because at that time i was quite desperate lah you know one thing that i noticed is he has grown in terms of his confidence right and and what i see is along the way he bounce back faster from adversity with the help of Noel yeah I landed a job yes so this is actually much needed lah for me to support myself the way i describe my life is like a roller coaster because there will be a lot of ups and a lot of downs but you have to be kind to yourself and uh acknowledge your weakness ah and have faith so i accept my situation now i cannot get back whatever i lost in the past ya so what i can do is just look ahead and make my life better now i'm looking forward to my uh coming bto so i always wanted to have my own home lah so i'm very happy and i'm looking forward to be living in that house uh my name is rafie uh and i'm 51 years old uh and im doing my best ya in life
