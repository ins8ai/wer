hi my name is jacqueline i'm a mother of three girls two of my elders are a set of twins with autism the two eldest one cheryl and eunice this year they will be 21 there was once i brought them for a paracanoe try and instead of staying in the canoe to try out they jumped into the pool and had a 30 minutes swim instead the journey to the paracanoe trial was very far it was from the most west to the east and after a while i see that they're smiling they're playing happily actually makes me feel is still worth it in the initial stages i wasn't able to understand them everything that i have even my laptop "i work and then i fell asleep when i wake up all the keys are gone you know my girl will practically peel off every single of the key then I was like how many $2,000 do i have to buy a new laptop those were the time ah was really really drive me nuts you know like i cannot even live normally some of them are really up to the state that i really do not know what to do and the thought of suicidal has always comes " to my mind at work i'm an employee at home i'm a mother so what about me who is checking i grew up in a single parent family i have many missed opportunities and that actually sets me wanting to give all that to my children so that they can grow up the way that i dream i could grow up with going shopping today ing so tell me shopping i would picture motherhood to be someone who actually bring her kids to enrichment classes go to good primary school and on weekends we can go out for meals shopping during school holidays we can go on vacation together i thought that would be jacqueline's life but life is not like that for me i was in denial until when they were about eight years old my paediatrician told me this very strong statement jac you have to face the reality your kids are mentally retarded at that time when i heard that description i was angry how dare you say such a word to a mother i don't think my child are mentally retarded they're just slow but there's this incident when i teach my twin how to take a sip from a cup but just that action took me three weeks three solid week everyday try for at least 2 hours on the day that she managed to pick up her cup and take a sip i find myself really crying finally finally finally she did it i also want myself to remember this feeling remember the time you teach her how to drink a take a sip from the cup you go today you lead the way yeah very good over the past twenty years a lots of ups and down in upbringing my girls but myself i felt that my mental health and mental strength is growing stronger I have grow so much that i don't always rely on external factors to tell me what i'm doing is right or wrong so even though i know this thing i do i may regret it later on but i feel that this is the best way i will do it and later on i regret i will say yes i've tried yeah i think that is the biggest strength that i have i have acquired in this journey
