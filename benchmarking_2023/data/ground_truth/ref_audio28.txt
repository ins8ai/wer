i think like last year somebody dm me like hi i need to tell you something your photos are on like a similar like group kind of thing yes i said like do you have any screenshots so the person said no there's no screenshots but i can send you the link to join but it was a very suspiciously long link and then it said you have to input your phone number I was like why welcome back to the tea talks and today we have not like new guests like nicole nicole’s so new exactly but we have a new guest like glennice welcome we talk a lot about scams today and how susceptible we are to scams have you guys fallen or have any encounter with scams before i've never really had a scam but i think maybe my closest interaction was that i i had some like credit card uh and debit card related fraud so basically i was overseas and then i don't know what prompted me to decide to check my credit card statement which i checked it like once every month or so right and then i saw like thousand plus plus plus deducted on my credit card and then i checked my debit card and for some reason a few other thousands deducted so i called them and they were like okay immediately you know cancel all your cards uh we'll like return you the money just like file your claims and whatever so yeah so scary but you got your money back i did i think the probably the scariest part was that i didn't know where it came from what was the source of like like you don’t know how they got the numbers correct correct cause I mean usually you use your phone for everything nowadays right like you link your cards to your phone and then you use your phones to like buy things from shops you scan here scan there so I think maybe it's through that but there's really no way to verify right so right ya no i've seen like um recent posts about people who download apps and then those like apps in turn track your bank movements or something like yeah wa i very scared now eh oh my gosh i better go and look at my statement so I just like okay as long as i got money to eat right speaking of like the scanning qr thing there was this case i don't know if you all saw on the news yeah yeah basically there was this like 60 year old woman right she saw an ad of this qr code that was like scan for like free bubble tea so she scanned it and she woke up in the morning i think twenty thousand dollars was taken from her bank account but it's exactly what wendy said right for bubble tea in one night cause ya lor like the software had access to her bank account details i would have fallen for that yeah i've downloaded many things for free like what like what so far there's been no scams but if a shop tells me just download this app or just fill in this survey for a free drink or free toppings at a bubble tea store and done everything allegedly like the woman who scan the qr code for the free bubble tea even though it was at the bubble tea shop the bubble tea shop say it wasn't by them she didn't even get her free bubble tea cake auntie so apparently what i read that you can do in order to protect yourself right is that if you're downloading an app you need to make sure that you are downloading from the proper app stores which is like apple app store and google play store make sure you check that the developer details are like real and then if you had already downloaded the app what you need to do is to turn your phone to airplane mode right turn off wifi and then run an an anti scam application just to make sure like everything is good you should also check whether you have any unauthorised bank transactions that has been done through another device yeah i hear now that the banks are actually rolling out this new measure to lock a certain amount that you have digitally like in a like a vault almost so it can't be digitally transferred out but if you want to like transfer money you have to probably go in person like to an atm or like a branch to like kind of like do that yourself yeah do that big transfer so like then have you ever fell for any uhm or encounter any like phishing scams i think like last year somebody dm me like hi i need to tell you something your photos are on a similar group kind of thing yeah and obviously i was so scared even if you don't send any explicit pictures to people or you don't take it in general you know what i mean i can still edit or something right there's this fear like did somebody record me in the changing room i say like do you have any screenshots cause that would be the first thing that you will do right yeah so the person said no there's no screenshots but i can send you the link to join then i said oh yes please i thought it will be like maybe a whatsapp group chat all this kind of things but it was a very suspiciously long link with those um with not a common domain name all these kind of things so i was like okay went in and then it said you have to input your phone number i was like why why isn't this just a telegram group chat why like it's not that difficult to join right yeah then i put 123 then i was like a bit suspicious already so i said it didn't work he said you have to put a real number i was like how do you know i didn't you know what i mean that’s so creepy yeah so i was like okay this is very suspicious i asked around i posted on my instagram story so a lot of people came and said like it's a scam don't fall for it all these kind of things it’s interesting though like how they take the weak spot and then they attack it correct they know where you're vulnerable and then they and it’s so common for these things to happen in singapore in terms of like spreading pictures around you know so girls always have that lingering fear it's so scary and to exploit it it's just very evil yeah the message itself was crafted in a very friendly and personal way like hi there's a there’s pictures of you going around uh this very important could you check your messages that kind of thing so it's like okay the conversations float very personal like it was really somebody talking to me dang but nowadays i tell you like scams not only evolve with like technology but like like what you said like how they pray on people's vulnerabilities and um emotions as well uh to kind of like get money out of them basically someone approach this person to say that they have a job offer they are from job street and then they ask the person to give a sum of money with promised like returns you know i think you’ve heard of this ya ya this case actually happened to my actual friend like i have a very close friend of mine that went through this exact sounds exactly the same so it's through telegram yeah it's telegram like a conversation kind of thing she was quite skeptical initially but once she transferred right and then she saw the returns and there's this trust building basis that you go through right and once you realise eh actually the money quite easy to earn ah so you would dare to invest a little more she continued to invest continued to give until one day the return didn't come back yeah so that was when it got really bad and they didn't get back to her and that was when she realised oh my god this is a scam because this is it i just got scammed because it's twenty k it boils up to twenty k is a lot of money she didn't twenty k gone all they can do is make a police report about it yeah damn jialat do you all feel that you will fall for something like that or would you all blame yourselves if you do i was gonna say i think previously i used to think that aiya only old people fall for scam but no leh i think increasingly with the scam tactics On the rise I think i don't want to say that i will never i think there's a high possibility that it might happen i hear that there's some ways that you can prevent new job scams which is basically if a company approaches you you should do background research on the company also don't pay to secure a job offer yeah cause i think it's a bit weird don't fall for this too good to be true true uhm you do something small and then you get a quick buck and don't give out your personal details like your phone number yeah so i think that's how you kind of at least these we can just think of this yeah mitigate yeah there's this app called scam shield the fox icon right you've used it before i have it on my phone basically just installed it once and then set it up once uh it prevents scammers from calling you in the first place oh yeah that's really annoying install now i'm installing right talking about glennice um just now you were saying that this uh sharing your stories online helps to normalise conversation i was watching tiktok and then i saw a video of this girl who was talking about how she got scammed by this rental facebook market place rental posting so basically what happened was that she saw a posting on facebook and then she contacted the agent because she was interested in the viewing so the agent was like okay ya it’s available for you to come out today uh but i'm not free so i get my pa to bring you so i was like okay ya sure so she went with the pa to go and see the house Like an actual person like an actual person oh my gosh an actual house okay she was like oh ya location very nice very good price not bad she was like i push my luck ask for like a slightly lower monthly fee then the agent very quickly yeah can can can no problem no problem no fight like no nothing then she was like okay a bit sus they started to like oh yeah can quickly sign you know like if you like it today then we sign it today which is really like usually doesn't really happen that way yeah you need some discussion correct and there's like a bit of like back and forth what she did was that she went to ask one of her friends who is a real estate agent to go and check like their real estate agent depository repository of agent numbers to see if that agent is real in the end couldn't find then she was like it's a scam so in the end didn't sign and she got away yeah speaking of shopping online I was on instagram scrolling and then this ad came out for a moon lamp basically a lamp shaped like a moon okay it's quite cute lah yeah it's like wah so lamp can change colour and all that right so i was like oh my god it looks so nice so i was like oh my god i want to buy one week later i think i was checking and then i was then i realised eh like i have no news about my lamp coming right then i went to find the i don't think is it i got a receipt or something but i remember where i bought the thing from so i went to search online like this website and it didn't exist then uhm but did you like check for reviews no i didn't get i just like moon lamp i have to have it i have to have this moon lamp put in my card details my house address then i was like oh my god i went to check my bank account to see if there was any other transactions but i mean don't have lah it was just that moon lamp that was deducted then i was like oh damn thank god it was just like that one like item yeah so if you shop online or any on any like e commerce website please remember to check reviews and i think use safe payment methods yeah don't be like don't be impulsive yeah i think read reviews nowadays i read a lot of reviews to see like i mean okay hearing all the stories shared today i realised that everyone of us has kind of eh no actually except for you thank you people always say i look scammable but i am very diligent in checking things i think out of everything
