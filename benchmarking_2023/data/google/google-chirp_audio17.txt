c r e sorry this one is b r e what you think of my sign language little bit hard to understand right later the video is out he better check subtitles i skate later the def com i'm waiting i'm one of the co-founders of f coffee hi my name s a l a hu d d i n i do service and prepare food and drinks and casuring as well if customer come in how you communicate with them so customer will write and point at the menu and all right with pad ipad your team scared of you while din is dead we also have james with autism and joshua with mild intellectual disability if there's no din they will take a longer time to do things he is the one that would push them to do faster and to meet timing for youtube i learn the alphabet then other stuff is either he or paulin teach but will make you feel very very angry it's more of the things in the cafe uh which they forgot how to do and then he'll just be more patient uh to teach them again repeatedly sometimes people with special needs do get anxious easily because of sudden changes in environment or if you try to show them in an unexpected situation so that's the thing with working with my supervisors they are very very patient people and that's why also need to come in and tell them they have to share with me and not just keep quiet to themselves they also didn't want me to worry about it he tought me quite a few skills like the cutting skills when using the knife and he's a very kind and caring person and then also very encouraging were you worried you cannot find job part to find job with death so you share with your family that you are the supervisor and then they are surprised yeah what make you feel happy working here the staff the customers and with other supervisors they go out many times together the idea for a social enterprise came about during like my undergraduate years learning about the different marginalized communities and feeling injustice i know how it feels like to not be included in activities with friends and so on and so forth so if these group of people in our society are being left out how can i then create something on a larger scale for other people to also accept them meaningfully into society we don't put up science to say that we have people of disabilities because my staff also want to manage any customers that come along the way i think that's part of the the job that we all want to do yeah regardless of this abilities
