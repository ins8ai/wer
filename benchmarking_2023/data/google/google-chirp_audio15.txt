hi my name is jacklyn i'm a mother of three girls two of my elders are a set of twins with autism the two elders one sharil and yunie this year they will be 21 there was once i brought them for a para cano try and instead of staying in the kanno to try out they jump into the pool and a 30 minute swim instead the journey to the um paraaka neutral was very far it was from the most west to the east and after a while i see that they are smiling they are playing happily actually makes me feel is still worth it in the initial stages i wasn't able to understand them why you cry you cry so hard everything that i have even my left "top i work and then i fell asleep when i wake up all the keys are gone my girl would practically peel off every single of the key and i was like how many $2,00 do i have to buy a new laptop those were the time was really really drive me nuts and like i cannot even leave normally some of them are really up to the state that i really do not know what to do and the thought of suicider has always come" to my mind at work i'm an employee at home i'm a mother so what about me who is checklin i grow up in a single parent family i have many missed opportunities and that actually sets me wanting to give all that to my children that they can grow up the way that i dream i could grow up with going shopping today so tell me shopping i would picture motherhood to be someone who actually bring her kids to enrichment classes go to good primary school and on weekends we can go out for meals shopping during school holidays we can go on vacation together i thought that would be jacklin's life but life is not like that for me i was in deniar until when they were about eight years old my patitrition told me this very strong statement jack you have to face the reality your kids are mentally retarded at the time when i heard that that description i i was angry how dare you say such a word to a mother i don't think my child are mentally retarded they are just slow but there's this incident i teach my twin how to take a seat from a cup but just that action took me three weeks three solid weeks every day try for at least 2 hours on the day that she managed to pick up her cup and take a sip i find myself really crying finally finally finally she did it i also want myself to remember this feeling remember the time you teach her how to drink a take a sip from the cup you go today you really the way yeah very good over the past 20 years a lots of ups and down in upbringing my girls but myself i felt that my mental health mental strength is growing stronger i have grow so much that i don't always rely on external factors to tell me what i'm doing is right or wrong so even though i know this thing i do i may regret it later on but i feel that this is the best way i will do it and later i request i will say yes i have tried yeah i think that is the biggest strength that i have i have acquired in this journey
