i just think that life is more beautiful with more colors it should not be just restricted to painting or flower arrangement i think food can also be fun with colors as well hello i'm joy from ualice young delights um selling noodles for the past free over years why do i make colored panman food has to be appealing by looking at it and you feel like you want to eat it i'm sure that your appetite will be much better as well it's made fresh every day we don't use any food coloring in our food when making the dough you see like it's meant to be a comfort food it's meant to be healthy if you use a a food color when you actually cook it all these colorings will actually come out when you take out the door the door will probably be white if it is natural from the fruit itself or from the veggie itself the soup base would just be a slight tinge of the color i wanted the four primary colors of red blue yellow and green for red that's the beetroot one the blue is the blue pee the yellow is the pumpkin the green one is the spinach every different color has got s different property so spinach because of its fiber for people who have bow movement problems yeah that's also a very good thing beat root is an antioxidant so there's a prevention of cancer pumpkin it's very rich in vitamin c it actually gives a glow blue pee if you consume it daily it can give you very good shiny hair promotes better eyes so they have their own personality they have their own characteristics it's just like my play-doh it's fun playing with what you actually cook my mom is the main catalyst as to why i started to learn how to cook my grandmother passed away when i was 16 after that we kind of like lost the great cook we started eating out and i noticed that my mom was eating lesser and lesser i think that throughout all these years my mom has always been very used to having home cook food i thought myself actually why not i could try so i started asking like my aunties people who i feel were really great cooks and eventually i came up with my own recipe if it wasn't for her i think i would never have found my passion that hey i actually like cooking the best satisfaction comes when people come up to you and say that your pamen is really good it gives me that home cook feel it's much better than having a pay rice better than striking 40 that's actually what is keeping me going they don't have to tell you that this is the best you don't have to be the best there will definitely be somebody better than you but as long as it's something that when they eat it they feel that this is the right taste for them i think that is that is good enough for me
