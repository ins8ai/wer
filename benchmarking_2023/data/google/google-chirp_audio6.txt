mr speaker let me thank the minister for the for to to for the clarifications as well as uh for clearing the air on this issue in fact many of us have uh received feedback from our residents that uh that given comments that every time the government increase subsidy the childcare operator will increase their fees you know it seems to be corresponding but i think i thank the minister for producing the the data as well the statistics that's so important it is still quite tough for middle income families uh which have a few a few children in childcare especially the even with the subsidy itself they may not be they may find it tough for for their monthly income the other group that i'm a little bit concerned with is uh for the non-working motherers i think there i understand there's additional subsidy for non-working mothers if they fulfill the criteria you know my take is that currently now how many of these children are belong enjoy subsis are belonging to the non-working meters can we equalize both groups instead of making apply you to this criteria if you were to put working mothers or non-working mothers aside how much more increase in terms of subsidies what the government has to pay rather to to make the working marters non-working marters going apply for additional subsidy thanks i think the member for his questions every year some preschool operators will make some adjustments to their fees there are many many operators private not for profit as well as moe kindergardens so "every year there will be some adjustments whether or not we make adjustments to our subsidies so that i hope that clears the misunderstanding and in fact the vast majority of households earning 12,000 and below to see reduction in charld care fees there are of course some centers private operators that charge say thousands of dollars in fees and make adjustments in the hundreds of dollars that is quite a different situation all together but for the vast vast majority" they should see fall in childcare fees from january next year and as i said from january 2021 for partner operators we will bring down the feeps even further and thereafter the anchor operators will see a fall as well uh so that is on your first question the second point is on families with many children and so apart from looking at total household income we also uh look at for families with many dependents and more children in preschool we will look at it from a per capita basis so that they can get even more support on non-working mothers the support provided to them takes into account the fact that because they're working they will need full day childcare and by working mother we talking about working two days a week and that can include the informal sector as well so there is a degree of flexibility and in fact working mother status is conferred the mother works for two days a week or 50 roughly 56 hours a month we do a grand special approval if mothers have uh caregiving needs for children younger than 24 months or if they're looking after other dependents for those who are looking for employment we make concessions for them and allow them to benefit from the full subsidy and for those who are non-working mothers what they can do is they can go for the basic subsidy for full full day child care or if not in they are at home with no other uh caregiving responsibilities other for the other than their young children then there is the option to go for kindergarden with kiifa subsidies so that half day they get the pedagogical support the other half day time with the parents time with family family bonding time
