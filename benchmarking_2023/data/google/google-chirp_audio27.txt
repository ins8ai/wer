i don't know how we display our own signs of aggression maybe we take out a textbook in your faces hi i'm hafiz i am give hi bry i am lea and this is  so in today's episode of chip chets we will be talking about boy school culture okay before we start please tell us which school you guys are from okay so i was from uh rafels institution from set one to set four so that was my my b but it was my boys school period i was from st michael's primary school now known as saintt joseph's junior then after that i went on today i went to saint steven's for primary school and then i went to uh saint pats otherwise known as saint patrick school for six uh four years in secondary school yeah from i was not from a boy school but i was from j talking about the experiences that you guys had uh going to a boy school uh hafiz maybe you can start off with you you know why because you came from koait school first and then you went into a boy school so how was that like for you okay for me like it was quite a game changer because back in primary school i was i was still very shy i remember some girls like used to bully me that time yeah legit so i was eating food and then they took my fox and so when i went to secondary school it was all boys then like i didn't have good to like disturb me or like bully me okay referles like to be honest when you think of it like you think like you just be like a bunch of nerds or like people just want to study but yeah like the friends that i mixed with mostly quite rowdy then like yeah maybe that's why i'm like this now but but it was an interesting change for you guys is it a similar experience like the school like the boy school very rowdy on because it is what i think of boys school we get out a lot of nonsense lah like you know like play prank on teachers each other uh we'll find uh like you go through like the highs and lows all together right yeah uh so i don't know if it's like a thing for mixed schools where there are girls but i see for an all boy school we used to get like public kingning every day like not everybody like those one by one do you have any casess of like bullying in school i was the bully okay okay i i didn't consider it bullying essentially it was just my group of friends we didn't bully anyone i don't i think it's a big group thing i just like think this guy looks funny or something the tell my friends guys you know this guy his spex right his degree 100 degrees okay then everybody will rush to this person it's a bullying okay i understand what you trying to say is that you just making fun that kind of thing but then uly speaking it is boolying like yeah at the time when we all like boys and like childish we like didn't know better though yeah i think for me and my is very similar to what give is just so it's just the dynamics of our group when something funny happens or when someone says something funny then we just like attack the person yeah that person can still be one of our friends is it very normal to have fights in school in my school mine is like every day there was a fight so the most epic one right and this was like a police case oh my god there was this two friends so they were having a conversation during recess and then his friend apparently said that his girlfriend uh is very ugly so he got very angry and wled up that he took his f and yes yes yes so he became known as like the fox stamber the friend had go hospital yeah then the friend went hospital right apparently he like four dots  so like what spread naturally then our principal told us doing like this assembly said if there are news reporters outside the school please don't talk to anybody but everyone oh my god do you have like um crushes on like female teachers definitely yeah very normal for me okay especially because from all boy school right there are no females around except the teachers yeah because i see these teachers all the time right and they carry themselves in a certain way that makes me a little bit more attracted to characteristics like like that in other girls crushes i wouldn't say like a serious oh my god mam i love you yeah there was a guy i know how to just when they talk then they walk down the row then he put his elbow at the corner of the desk then when her butt like graced his elbow right then he hit you then she like oh sorry then he's like oh sorry sorry but actually he was like did he intentionally actually sexual harasmer there if you think about this so there was one time there was this uh really teacher the class she had to realize was a very rowdy class and basically like they took off their shirts and they started doing this around her yeah oh my god i would be terrified if i was opposition i don't like sexual harasma or what's yeah in that case i think like especially now if it's in a 2019 context right it's definitely sexual harassment 10 years ago it was still sexual harassment it was still indecenty not that it was overlooked ya it was okay i guess it is was overlooked also so um is there any like ranking between like the boys school or do you all have a particular perceive notion of any other school do you like this school you don't like this school that kind of thing i think for me for for ri boys because like i think our top rivals would be catholic cat high boys okay because firstly we are within the same vicinity every time we see high boy or what i don't how we display like our own signs of aggression maybe we take out a textbook in your faces ya but it's like something about high boys i think also because like they don't have long pants once we reach section that is something that we always like internally like disturb them yeah but it's all just like mindless benter amongst ourself sometimes when i see ri boys i thinking what these people just take our uniform but then put oh my god say uniform oh my god the same uniform what the i think like for sets right like we honestly did not give two shits about the academic ranking that but for some reason i don't know why we always dislike sji yeah like i always felt like sji were like the the nerdier and cool version of us yeah eventually we outgo that lah because after all we are like brother school you mentioned something about like what the sets boys who go to don't where see the casey girls what was that you say yeah so basically after school every day right there were a few like hot spots where cs boys will go to to like look at uh sac girls or like kc girls okay yeah so we always would go to like max or parade or like the marine parade the market area sgi the nearest go to us like literally like like 500 meters down is scgs what i have heard is that all some of the the younger boys used to walk over the scegs and they tr b inside but i think the scs girls didn't give a damb about us most of the time if i'm not wrong you will be the scegs girls with the acs guys got the r g s girls okay funny as it is the hot spot for me for my friends at least was mishan what they got quite close to a group of r g s girls and cresen or seda girls also yeah so what they would do is have sty sessions after school we move on to maybe talking about like some conceptions or assumptions people have about boy school boys yeah and then actually one of them uh was because i we did a episode on the girl school culture right and then everybody oh all girls school girls are lesbian the is it the opposite for guys today people have the assumption that all we are again i think there's definitely like a percentage in sets like but we always used to make fun of sji of being like the gayer school i don't know why maybe because of the stuff that we do together when we are in school we would strip someone down to his underway in class like after class e and then just leave him in below no no but as in he's our friend okay maybe that's why people call us okay we know we are not i think maybe it stems from like how close we are as like bros yeah so like we stay over each other's house like each other's yeah one of the things that some ask me to us was that uh boys cool boys are homophobic then because people make all these comments so i think in sets it's really quite there was this guy who posted on his blog that he went on a date with a guy from another school that was like a si or something when he posted then after that weekend he came back on a monday right everyone just started like shouting at him like hey gay then like people throw tissue people would show like their things at him he just walked down the corridor but he wasn't like affected we knewho was k but we didn't uh we did nobody believe them one of the girls asked me to ask your do you play soccer every recess i want to say every recess there are days that we have to really eat cuz hungry right i wasn't one of the soccer click yeah another misconception right is that uh boys school boys are very rich my perception is that like all boys school for example like acs or saint andrews are the rich ones yeah then sats like no lah i think for ri maybe because like is the branding the image of an r i boy that they portray or they like to push out is someone very prem very proper so like might come across as coming from a rich family or wealthy background even though like there are people who are very rich and stuff but i think at the end of the day like they didn't really like use this to look down on other people i don't know why people say that because okay i don't know if about now but back then there was this program called uh something about welfare assistance for the the more underprivilege kids um no doubt i have to say that some of us come from an above average household even in school right they teach us to be independent of our parents especially in terms of like finances so as much as i came from from an above household right i was actually some some poor dog i was living like day to day day on the $2 maybe cuz we are in independent school yeah the more wealthier parents yeah are more willing to spend a little bit more money to send their child to like guess all girls or all boys school people assume boy school boys are like very more elite i think we will be a lot from like also like because ri is also a very elite school i think it really bows down to who you as a person and regards of what school you come from and also like the kind of friends you mix with for me i i couldn't really experience any of this like uh pretentious nature or elity mindset all the perceptions right are created by our parents generation then they just like pass down to us then that's what we think looking back at your younger self do you have any advice for yourself or uh advice for people who are currently in a boy school don't take out your clothes in oh my god i think for boy school at least like sometimes you might get too carried away in terms of like having too much fun with your friends yeah but i think you still have to take note of like how important like academics actually is also it's not something that you can just like throw away lah but instead use your dynamics as a brows group to encourage each other or to push each other then that's great because really the influence that we have on one another i would say is very very strong it's good to in the candy for maybe an hour and just like just talk shit because this is how boys school boys bond if i have kids in the future right i would still send them to like send pets or if it's a daughter i'll send them to ije mm yeah cuz i think the culture is very unique i think it's it's good to take away with so that you know no matter what school you go to is like you need to work like you just work hard and like you don't be yourself make good friends and that's great don't discriminate based on your school okay so we don't say we concluded this ep talking about boy school culture and if you guys are from boy school and you feel like you
