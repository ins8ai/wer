like for my partner and i to make our living room what we consider cozy and our bed room like what we consider cozy is very nice like before going to bait i used to look at her now i now i look at the corner that i look at her in the morning okay okay okay okay and we are back for another episode of tetox yay and we are here to talk about housing cuz we are all so first time house owners okay maybe can say your um type of housing maybe your marital status that kind of stuff so my name is pefang and then um i am 28 this year attach not married yet i am getting a flat in joong east in 5 years time in 2028 i'm ben i'm 32 this year i'm married and i have a resale flat in pongo yeah i just moved in like two months ago yeah um bella 35 i stay in a private condo um it's a studio apartment so it's pretty small got swimming pool swimming pool yeah hi my name is yuhing uh i'm 30 this year i'm recently engaged my video is in tampanese yeah yeah tempanese yeah suddenly silent and no one ch for him myself okay so we're going to play this game called like would you rather so there are certain like options here so would you rather a spend less for a less ideal location or would you be pay more for an ideal location okay so who is a yeah is the westies yeah maybe they did really spend less compared to us okay so you all say you all pay less for less ideal location so what your for go in your choice uh not choosing tiong baru over chorang is oh yeah i was like at the top my head before saying like the price i was like baru cuz like if the stoll move you also move no but there's just like a greater proportion of like good food in that area yeah and then the estate got also looks very like um nice and all like very chill vibes that kind of thing but um my situation is not ideal in the sense that i don't earn that much for me to afford that location so i need to like prioritize on whatever i can afford so i decided to go for like joangs instate cuz i think joang is like there's a lot of like shopping malls and like a lot of amanities there also but you was location a issue an issue so actually my location is quite ideal already because i think when my partner and i were discussing right we kind of wanted either bo or temponese we we like tempones lah but we forgot a lot of things because for us we weren't expecting to get a flat during the exercise but we did and when when it was our turn to choose a flat we did have high floor options left so ibto mean as much as we wanted to also stay like thirty floor that kind right we don't have a choice lah so that's one thing that we had to forgo yeah those are things that unfortunately i can't choose but my price is quite healthy for me to think about so i don't feel anxious thinking that oh my goodness i need to pay so much yeah i think for me location is one of the primary consideration your location cost how much okay not bongol perse but like like within the estate wanted something that was more accessible and had like facilities or amities nearby what's important for you i think commute to work for one yeah i think that was the main thing that my partner and i were looking at yeah on space commute to work is further i mean but that's where you save on cost and then you also stay near your parents correct yeah so uh i stay within just nice within the 4km radius so i managed to get the proximity housing grant as well yeah so i think i was just like within 100 meters if i throw a stone ready the stone won't get the okay so since you say you pay less for a less ideal location i know like how much did your house cost like roughly mine was about 320k for four room flat nice nice that's a good number yeah it's enough uh around is similar to your cost um 370 ah okay okay i'm quite envious when i hear all the betail prices so mine's resel right so i pay about close to half a million there about for forum no but then you get your flat faster so yeah you have to wait i mean you move in already but they still waiting we are still in the waiting you know we just see the model then like happy happy igs five years later see you that kind i don't think i can to like commit that and like you just see the model i don't know when you think about the cost you can commit thanks so so what about the cost for you okay so i like here 300 here 500 then like i di stupid for doing this because you all have partners i bought this like as a single uh so my place for studio apartment which is like them tiny is uh 700 700 okay when i hear all of your amounts it's like oh my god like more than double of i can buy two btos two forums not wrong wait but where is it uh younos yours i think i should make more friends in the east right you can move here change your b t o no no then i'll invite you all to the west also i think people won't go but okay you can try okay let me know in five years i put it on my cause oh yeah my house on me if you are two friend in five years time okay okay would you rather a buy a resele flat or private property to move in earlier or b buy a b t o and move in later sorry i'm speaking properly and you cannot register okay who is a i'm half half i cannot let me put your hand here why half half say i mean clearly i bought a resale because i wanted the convenience of being able to move in round now right but at the same time i see the benefits of having a bto whereby you get something at the last subsidized rate yeah you you do have to wait but it saves you a lot of money in the long run as well my sports and i we've been renting for a couple of years already so we are very used to having our own space you know i love living with my parents and i and i appreciate them for for all that but i also really like having my own space so i don't think it's something that i can go back to so i think we would still go for a resale actually i think that's quite a great point because a lot of uh couples want that freedom also like for us for me and my partner sometimes you we are just like randomly check about things and we are think about how nice it is if we had our own space like now right yeah yeah okay so the situation around me getting my video was that it was a decision that we we didn't expect to make because it wasn't a very ideal unit lah for her and she really like the dream home she envision wasn't like facing the car park on the fourth floor yeah so why did your partner decide to like keep the flat okay so after discussing for four months right i think one fine day she just woke up and she's like you know what let's just try and make this home the best home we can then if even if we don't like it down the road if like she cannot stand like you know the the cuck noises or whatever we will just find a new place to live like it's not like we have to commit to something at this point in our lives it's the idea that you make your dream home not that the dream home is given to you so payng would you ren before you get your bto i haven't really thought that question yeah so like just now just now when you are talking about it i was like thinking at the b on my head like w should i run or cuz a lot of people have asked me also and they are like five years you will be like 30 30 plus like in in that time ready then how to start family blah blah blah thing you are too old for that then i'm like i'm like thanks for the reminder at all like i don't know like maybe an alternative is to similar to um's cases my boyfriend will just come over and like leaf with me i mean i haven't like brought up that topic and all cuz um it's not something that we are considering at that moment you also haven't proposed yeah yellow right where is how can where is your proposal where is your proposal okay i haven't even like talked to him like so i think for bella um she mentioned just now that she needs to pay 700k right like in a lump not not really a lumsum but yeah i don't have the 700k but yeah yeah correct so for us like at least we get like the the e h g grand enhanced housing grant so basically it's a grand given by uh h d v for you to offset some of the cost of financing the house i mean your house cost like 700k right so how do you afford it i can't afford it the video sometimes i wonder too i think it's a commitment that you you decided on right so there will be certain life changes like previously i always thought of you every few years i will live a year overseas um but now with a house then you have to ask yourself you know can you afford it or like i must always have a job but definitely like having such a big financial commitment is it's huge then just got to make adjustments to my lifestyle law i cancel disney plus subscription like just really just take note of like every single month like now i have a table of like all my expenditure and all the loans i have to pay and then i feel like a lot of people don't i mean the people i know at least right didn't think about that until they committed to a housing option like for example they will be like oh yeah i can afford it but then when they go for the housing option that they won then they realize oh now i have to like change a lot to my life if you haven't gotten a house it's a good idea to start thinking about all these things first i wish i i thought about that more because you are a planner no no she she is a my partner is a planner i wasn't yeah because if she didn't kick start the whole process of like let's plant our finances right i would have been a lot more anxious about my house so the idea that that you know we have to sit down and think about okay if we want to afford this what should our life look like or what should our lifestyle be like okay ready for the last one yes this looks very long so paying should slowly digest and tell us i digest first uh would you rather a buy your dream house as your first home and stay there in the long run or be buy a oh this handwriting a bit ugly but or be buy a starter home and upgrade at a later time wah starter home like minecraft eh i think this is a a for me at the moment okay buy your dreamhouse and stay in the long run is my current situation is a for me okay is that what you have chosen i thought your dream house is tiong baru please that's dream a one then this is dream a2 so still dreamhouse still can consider dreamhouse lah yeah happy for you i mean they are okay teong baru is dream a one because of the location location is ideal yeah but drung east is a2 because um the location is not as ideal as teong baru mhm but the height is great the height is great yes so it's still consider dream okay that's my definition so so why then why why did why were your like this is starter and i mean cost is a big thing obviously like for example her dream home i say is a condour right but given our current finances it's a bit hard for us to look at a condo and be like i want to buy it then your dream home my dream home is as long as it's nice and it has a very nice kitchen i'm happy with it but unfortunately that also means there a lot of condos right because just very small right yeah so we do have to like wear pros and cons like yeah but happy wife happy life she want actually say for you your home is where my baby is that's home correct my dream home is where my where my wife is where my future wife is trying to be boyfriend of the year boyfriend of the year and i think the bonus of having a video that a lot of people don't necessarily think about is the fact that like waiting no batting waiting means that you have time to build up your finances you have time to to progress in your career to a more stable place so that when you actually get the house you don't feel anxious about a lot of things okay or ben you just recently moved in so was it very exciting like seeing everything done up like how you planned it to be yes like it's nice to be able to finally decorate and like make something your own or like you everyone has a different idea of cozy so for us like for my partner and to make our living room what we consider cozy and our bed room like what we consider cozy is very nice like like before going to bed i used to look at her now i now i look at the corner that i look at her in the morning okay okay okay so as first time house owners like what you're most excited about i want to hear pr one oh but i need to think i haven't really think about it i think i was excited to host my first house party hey i very excited also about that excited what you excited about no that one then after that when it's so nice already right then you invite people to your house then you're like wow look at people's house yeah because i've been going to a lot of house parties i think it's having that space to yourself to be able to like invite people over and i don't know create memories in that house good vibes good vibes it's nice to have friends over it's true ben inv just say went to our house he just moving only he still got all the cover boxes so take some time give him some time oh yeah correct sorry you have been busy so i think like a lot of people definitely would want to get some advice if they can you know on the whole process of being a first time house owner so what's the most important advice you actually give to people who are looking to get their first place i think being a first time home owner can be quite daunting to a lot of people and sometimes in the process of getting the house you might feel like you know you never get what you want what's more important is that as long as you learn how to to manage the good to have versus the must have right you will still eventually get a nice place lah a place that you can call your own yeah actually the ideal home that you have in your head is really just a concept right at the end of the day yeah it's like if it fulfills your mus then i think it's good enough it can be after home yeah the ideal home is just a place for us to host hours parties i i also i just want to add on also like cuuse um everyone have different opinions about like what an idea home is right like for example we have three isties and weste this all right then every time i can this like my house is like huh why the west very good may the location at the end of the day like i'll be like uh no i i like my current home like it is the i it is like a pretty good location for me and like there are a lot of like good things that come along with it i'll be just like i'm happy alone yo can say whatever you want i'll leave that to five years later you'll make your own decision from that wow i'm quite convinced now i'm very curious about the west yeah little you all go the very high expectations yeah i won't no the worst won't disappoint i hope it has been great like listening to the experience of like different types of home owners yeah if you have any questions you can leave it in the comment section and i hope you enjoy this episode thank you thank
