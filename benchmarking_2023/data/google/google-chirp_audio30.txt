it came as kind of a blindside for me because i was let go from like my job at midnight of singapore time i was logged out of everything already yeah on that days so that days what are we gonna talk about today we are going to talk about workplace rejection ooh skully this episode one of us will get rejected stay tuned to the end of the episode to see who get fired no just kidding no no no no how do you deal with rejections no huh what are you rejecting me and my question um my first experience of rejection i was i always remember i was sixteen sixteen and i plucked out on my courage to like call this guy to ask him up for prom and he said no not like i think i'm the best person out there but yeah it was like a yeah i thought we were pretty good friends for you to say yeah so baller yeah if you're out there watching like this person yeah you said no to wendy hello hello so i don't necessarily feel a lot from my work rejections but for the 2022 one um it was it came as kind of a blindside for me because i was let go from like my job and i'm just like i have a zoom call schedule and then like i entered a zoom call like okay cool what's like this about and then like so you have fifteen days left um and your fifteen days notice starts now and you are just not right fit for the company and we felt that it's better this way and um you don't have to work the next fifteen days your work stops today you just straight away the day yeah so i ask so i say so why um like you know uh is there something i can do was something i was why wasn't doing um all he said was just you're not a right fit for the company like am i such a bad person like that you have to cut me off now and um it's not even i work the nicks like notice you know it's like now and gone you're gone i was super sad that night when it happened because um at midnight of singapore time i was logged out of everything already yeah on the day so yeah that day what the heck so i was like in my mind i was like what i do that offend you did i like like why is it so like um cut like so yeah so cut throat so cut throat and cold yeah anyway so um i felt super set that day because i think i was like wondering like okay so am i just not cut out to do this kind of work yeah um i mean background and context it's a program managing because i also came the project managing but but this is a more creative creative aspect then i wasn't um so well versed in like content creating and videos and all that so then it's like i have no experience there then like the yeah it's kind of like your security is just gone then would you say they are right when they say you're not a good fit there so after that yes i mean like thinking about it yeah i do feel like okay it if i would have pushed the stay then yes it would just be me trying to like uh putting up a friend yeah to work yeah in a place where i don't feel the most passionate right so in that sense that work rejection sort of like was something good because it let you to find a place that you feel passionate for i mean after that i talk to a friend and then after talking to that friend i kind of uh okay he okay that friend is now my partner but anyways the night he was just saying like okay um cuz i have a faith right so man's rejection is god's direction so kind of like you may feel like you are rejected in this one area and like you feel like all is loss but it might actually be an opening to another place that you can go and like a different direction you can go to sometime we might be forced to find that silver lining ourself in order to make the process much more purposeful and enjoyable like for example i want always wanted to be a nurse can cannot tell right yeah yeah yeah always wanted to be a nurse so i applied for nursing so many times and i got rejected so many times i even get so many people to help me write recommendation letter you know like my the rid cross singapore cross director my my form teacher everyone i know to write saying that i will make a goodness i even went to see the mp wow i went to see the mp to to get and then they just say no like got no reasoning oh they didn't they never even give any reason it's just straight up uh on the computer in a way i say is there a silver lining because uh through the years after the rejection and everything it allowed me to find passion in other areas that i never thought i had like community services is because i didn't get do nursing right that's why i got myself involved in so many volunteering work so the desire to help people is still there yeah the desire to help people is still there and i'm like oh actually i can help people through this way too it's not too bad i'm glad i didn't get accepted because if i did right i don't think i'll be sitting here right i don't think i'll be sitting here renting about why i cannot go intoressing yeah i guess cuz i i didn't really face like huge huge work rejections or career rejections because like i was on a scholarship so it really dictated the path that i was going to take i was going to be in moe um for minimum four years because of the contract so when i left that job and then traveled and then came back to do a mic career ch change i realized that at 30 right i've never written a cv before and i did even have a linkedin page because i as a teacher you don't need linkedin and sometimes i feel like rejections help you to grow you know help you to put yourself out there more have that confidence cuz you face that rejection yeah and so was very very scary for me and i was just like yeah i wrote a quite a convincing cover letter starting with h is just a number  anyone respond i mean oh yes okay see it works would you know what would have to you if you were if your scholarship was rejected oh um no i mean i want to have like a nice answer to it but i was like no like confirm can get okay okay based on results it was really like i think i can get it and if i don't get it then um find other scholarship because my mom told me like i need to um fund my own university education so that was a really told to me like when i was in jc so that i cannot have um i cannot afford to fail yeah but not to say i don't face rejection on a daily basis like because of what we do as video journalists we need to find profiles we need to pitch out ideas to our bosses like it's a daily thing for us are going to say no and then there's no silver lining it's just no i have no other option like find another story find another um profile and you no one like that's your best profile that rejected you but you have no choice but to just deal with it so i think yeah in cases where there's no server lining then you just need to accept and move on or just have tin or yeah like yeah i mean like you rightly said the sticks are different for everybody yeah but i think one thing that was said to me that like really helps in uh dealing with rejection and like moving on it's like the worst thing that can happen is they say no it's true and then the best thing that can happen is to get something out of it yeah so i think when we are talking about this is it still feels quite like millennial concerns without kids or anything yeah whereas for people if they have family and then they face rejection right it's the sticks are a lot bigger yeah yeah yeah we definitely do have like more options given the kind of circumstances that we're in like it's really a sort of privilege i think in life you always have a lot of um you always go through a lot of nose and okay i don't deny you i will still feel sad yeah yeah like if i don't continue at ogs i'm still feel sad yeah for sure for sure keep us in ogs we went through a lot to come here i don't need to experience another like come uh part two like yeah yeah but i think it's just a perspective switch for me like at least personally in my own life in my mind i turn around and like it's like no not you no thank you to me but it's like no i want to thank you for saying that no no okay hi bella this is an et slot from n a please present as if you're teaching a class okay okay everybody wake up listen before we continue

that sucks happen to you boy you look at the the email for h d v you just like i don't think work rejection is my now it is a a big thing for me i told my current boyfriend that if you if this ever uh
