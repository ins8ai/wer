we have people who come in and give $2 for a buffet meal but we also have people who come in and give $50 just for closer i don't think it really matters how much everyone gives because at the end of the day if that's all they can afford that's all they can afford we always make enough for us to open the next day and continue serving people my name is harish i'm full-time employee at is an indian vegetarian restaurant that functions on a philosophy of atitithi devo baba or guest is god so if tomorrow god were to come to your house and have a meal you wouldn't give god a bill at the end of the day a lot of people the first that comes to mind is it's free food but we simply do not price our food we just want to provide home style food to anyone without them having to worry about the money initially when i first started off volunteering here it would really make me very very angry and very upset to see people giving $5 for a meal or even $2 or even $1 i remember this once this guy gave a very small amount for his meal and a few days later this guy comes back and he said i like to give back what i owe at that point i really thought to myself you know it was so easy for me to judge the person without really understanding what was going on in their own personal lives realize it's not my job to question how much people give instead my job is very simple my job is just serve good quality food and the money will come when it needs to come cuz you need the tosade to actually stick a little bit and then after it releases i've been making those now ever since i started in 2016 for lunchtime you can see me behind the dosaatawa making dosas uh yes this the key there are no tricks it's not like a tapenyakaki or something like that instead being at the live station helps me communicate with people and sometimes i find a lot of people indians especially giving a lot of wrong information to people who don't know much about tosait so for example we have a special type of tosade called a jafna tose when people see yellow color they're like oh it must be a pesterret or an aade which are actually two different styles of toses they don't even use rice in them so i'm always happy to stand there and correct them all the time people always asking me what i'm doing with my life and why am i working in a restaurant but i always knew i wanted to help people so i guess coming to unlakshmi and serving people this way has just been the right fit for me at the end of the day there's nothing more important in life than your own peace of mind and your own mental and personal happiness my grandmother and grandfather were one of the first few volunteers to come in seeing my grandparents come here and effortlessly serve for nearly 30 years i kind of caught that spirit i guess when anlakshmi first began it was a group of grandmothers and mothers who came together to help provide the recipes and cook when people come here and have a meal it feels like they're being fed by a loved one there's something really beautiful in being able to give back without expecting anything in return to serve someone good food and then they look at you say thank you so much i've been away from home for so long but today you help me remember my mother it's because the volunteers to come here are so involved are so passionate that i don't think money has ever been a factor for not just me but for any of us to serve here in anlakshmi
