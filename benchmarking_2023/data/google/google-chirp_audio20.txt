i find it quite therapeutic to clean dishes you have no cares in the word hopkin we say it's like you eat dirty you grow up dirty sometimes i ask what am i doing my life when i first started gets a dishwasher it was a real struggle i was very scared of the dirt in the field mana sini ah okay thank you bang you will see the grind and rotting food sometimes because of the smell it will make you like like gag cleaning is the brate ambaster of my family my mom she actually has been in this line for quite a while now couple of decades in fact i really respect her a lot because she is so bread winner she brought me and my sister up single handedly i was faced with the decision on whether i should go to uni or come into this dish washing line to help my mom but i realized that maybe you don't need a degree to dishes yeah i don't think she can keep going at this pace much longer so yeah i just needed to step in to help elevate this burden of her thank you my colleagues are all very old yeah they like my arma's age.éƒ½ it's just very wholesome i feel sometimes i'm walking with my arma like thatå•Š ä¸è¦ä¸è¦å¯ä»¥æˆ‘å—Ž technically like the earth right but they would actually buy me meal sometimes it's like they see me as their own grand kit i feel like people can't respect you if you don't know how to do it if you want to manage something you have to learn the nature of it and the best way is by doing it and if they had anything that they're struggling with or things that could be improved in terms of processes yeah i wanted to make that change it was also tough because sometimes when i bum into people that i actually know they will see like oh like how bad he mess up his life to be cleaning today and like washing dishes or like wearing the trash if i were to say like oh yeah this is my mom's company i'm working i feel that it's very snobbish it discredits all the heartwork that put it being a servant doesn't mean that you're the lowest in fact it's a joy to serve people growing up without a diet it made me somewhat insecure sometimes but it was in church that i found my confidence so i think growing up like that it has also stuck "with me that yeah i can find joy in serving people i started to turn like my coping mechanism to humor so if people like ask me boy,ä½ é€™æ¨£,ä½ è¦é€™æ¨£ i'll tell them,ç¾åœ¨ä¸å¥½ times are half whatever puts food on the table got to keep dripping this is really an honest living and you're serving the society you're doing something that yeah" many people wants to do it just so happens that for me it's cleaning and might not be the most glamorous but yeah it's still a form of serving people they always just in the background but they are the invisible force that keeps your everyday life running so i just hope that next time anyone sees a younger person cleaning it's not because they messed up their life but it is still job it is not put food on the table for my sister and i growing up
