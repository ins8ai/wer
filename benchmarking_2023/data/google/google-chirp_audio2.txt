people ask me a lot why don't i just go and become like this super high lawyer and then donate a lot of money to refugees it's not like my dream was always to be a hot to sell coffee at the hocker center i didn't even drink coffee the only reason i did this was to create livelihoods for refugees in thailand usually i have to get to the depot shop by seven plus 7:30 latest i got to pick up all the ingredients that amoi neds for the day like their bread their coffee beans and load it up into the car and then drive it all to army if i see like this on the way i'll be like oh today slow day you wonder like if there'll be any customer at all that kind of thing okay hello this is our logo for every cup that you drink your coffee 50 sens is going to the refugee who did the artwork on this car it's actually just black and white when it's printer in thailand then it's sent directly to these refugees who are we are working with they color in every single one of our cut will be unique because it's actually colored by someone different we try to commission enough stickers every month "so 300 stickers every month works out to 3,000 bucks and that is the average price of ren in outer bangkock actually before i started maroster i didn't even drink coffee i was a lawyer and all of my lawyer friends i'm hoping that matt rouster creates like a machine that converts the existing consumerism in singapore into meaningful livelihoods for refugees i don't want it to always just be aid and donations that are sustaining them  " no one wants to cut up for 3 hours or no one wants to go there and have to prove how posting they are to get the bag of rice why can't they just get the bag of rice themselves there's dignity in earning your own living and being able to look after your family yourself hi thank you so much people ask me like why refugees specifically right i think there was a time in my life where i really needed help and i needed a someone to speak up for me and to like fight for me because i was too weak to do it for myself at that period of time i also heard a lot about refugees it resonate a lot with me like what they're going through because no one will believe the story no one will help them and that's why i want to help i realized that for a lot of them they don't have the legal right to work the more pressing need was ren uh buy food for their children and i felt that it would be more useful for me to focus my attention on livelihoods and that's how i ended i was master everything okay i'll go back there for fun bye byye brioche making process is very long actually we take around six to eight hours i mean sometimes i'll think about it like maybe you just buy from like wholesaler you know like delhi france then you just be like second seller but i think it will affect cuz we already known for all this stuff so can't really change the menu now people will realize nothing sorry got no customer for your to film like for me i'm more of a warrior but i think my dad not so much so he'll just be like oh the seasons which for me i was like stress every like whenever it's down I like oh my gosh no  my normal life last time every lunch i will go to the gym which cost me like i think maybe 200 a month right after my gym i'll go and buy this $7 dollar chai late and i have this seven bucks it's crazy but i was still do it every single day yeah sometimes people ask me if i miss my old job right i do miss being an employee if anyone is a employee stay a employee don't become a employer because i've never experienced living so close to the margin before right mentally you're under a lot more uncertainty and that feeling of not knowing if you can cover this mental stress is what the refugees that i work with go through every day of their life i think one of the reasons that i continue even though it was a pretty hard time was okay we're supporting 11 refugees if i have to feel like this every day this like mental stress i can imagine 11 people have to feel like that without our programs the only reason i'm still here is because i feel like there's a bigger purpose to really shop the more cups we sell the more refugees we can on board to our program every cup metters every cup is literally like someone is behind the artwork on your cup and it's their life that you are like helping out
