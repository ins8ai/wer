i was thought that i'm being ignorant like every time they tried to call my name i did not respond i feel confused and the moment i was diagnosed with moderate hearing loss i did ask myself a lot is is this the end of my career am i still able to work in the world like you need to look after a cancer patients for yesterday she's got the chest pain so they take all the chops yeah okay after i informed my manager about my hearing loss she was also worried initially but she was always there for me she was telling me why not you give it a try and perform it with showing it this time maybe things will get better feel is all kindness like she's giving me a chance like for me to pursue my passion when i was younger i actually want to be a nurse because i was brought up by my single mother so whenever i witnessed my mom fall sick when i was younger i feel so helpless i did not know what to do so at the point of that i keep telling my mom i promise my mom like you know what i going to be a nurse one day so that whenever we fell sick right that i know what to do next because of my promise to my mom that keeps me going as a new hearing a user you tend to hear all the background noises that you haven't been hearing for the past 20 years sometimes the hospital environment can be very loud i'll be scanning and there's a beep sound at the same time there's another beep sound from the toilet call and telephone call at the same times yeah it's very overwhelming can hear all kinds of sounds like all come together so far from my experience my patience will not even know that i have hearing issues until i actually told them so uh it doesn't affect my performance and skills most of them cannot see unless you are right beside me because it's just a transparent dubing hanging around my year especially for cancer patients after receiving the chemotherapy they will be born to fall so it's very important for nurses like us to have a good hearing skills we have to be very alert so far so goodå•Š no matter how many times i've seen my patient pass on due to cancer um you will never be prepared when you love on diagnosed with cancer and last year my mom actually diagnosed with stage four cancer the doctor declared that she has to be imperative like feel as comfortable as possible before the end of life yeah so because of that i actually went back to malaysia just to look after my mom being a full-time caregiver it's scary to go through the process by herself she said that if i'm not around she will have died in the hospital instead of at home which is something that she didn't want to i was able to take care of her uh until her last day i slept with her until her last breath because her last words to me was um i feel safe with you huh ever since the mom pass on i actually switch to medical oncology because it's related to my mom's case and i would like to provide like the best of most comfort care for the same situation as my mom
