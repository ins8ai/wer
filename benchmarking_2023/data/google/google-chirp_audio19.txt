my friends and i were having a couple of drinks and my friend just said what kind of chaco you use i said i use japanese soap he said hey bro burning up very pretentious i think that was the best name we got so we just stuck with it hi my name is jeremy i'm the owner of burning oak and we've been operating for about four to five years now burning oak we are a dombburry place which is rice and meat on top so what we really specialize in is chagru meats we use only japanese charco and wood charco to grow all our items we are selling quite a lot of upskill things in such an environment we actually started with skewers and now we have only one skewer which is our short skewer the idea was conceived when i was walking in a streets of japan with my parents we saw this place owned by a japanese and he knew all his guests he knew exactly what they wanted when they came in and i wanted to create something similar here when we first started it was challenging a lot of people were very skeptical about this place waste of my money we prepared the closeÂ  you service our things i think a lot of motivation comes intrinsically where we see that we can produce results that nobody thought that we could take what you think is constructive from this hating and apply effectively to yourself ultimately it's a hidden gem to them yeah it's like a surprise fine in such an area the chaco itself when it burns it burns at a higher temperature so everything is nicely sit and the smoky flavor is different a lot of people say this is the taste of earlier times i found out that i like cooking when i was 14 it was difficult to come out as someone that wants to pursue this my parents and i explore the option of going to a culinary program for me it was i was pretty certain that i was going to follow this path all the way i guess i knew what i wanted to do since i was 14 every hawker there's a story and it's just so happens that i'm younger young people should pave the way for other younger people to let them see that actually i encourage more young people to explore the option of being a hawker to push boundaries of what a new age hawker center could be because there's a lot of emphasis on younger generations being a food entrepreneur i want to be a farmer like for real for real for someone that really likes to cook i think it's important for me to get in touch with the produce the lifestock the whole chain that i'm not currently exposed to it gives a deeper sense of appreciation of people who are actually doing this you learn to treasure ingredients more i think really that's the ultimate goal just to you real some chickens feed some pigs cat some cows and water some flies
