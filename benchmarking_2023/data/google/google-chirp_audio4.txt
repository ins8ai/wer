your bones are brittle you should not climb a lot of people will tell you at sixty seven is dangerous when i reach the top i have lots of claps and then they will then i'll tell them almost every gym that i go they know i'm auntie dolly i don't mind that because i think auntie is a sator of wisdom when i was in my early fifties and i was having a back problem she saw me doing stretching and then she said since you are stretching why don't you go and stretch on the wall she taught me the way to climb very fierce very fierce very fierce anything wrong not that late sometimes she say you're like a elephant on the wall when i started i have height phobia i try not to look down i look up i was worried like my mom might fall like scrape our wrist hit the head i think that was my worst fear but once she got a certain height i'm like okay pay me one million dollars because i let you down yeah then if i don't finish she won't let me down when you reach the top you find that you have accomplished something i learn to be more confident until now i don't have bad ag it also overcomes my heightphobia right now any hanging bridge you give me no problem my first climb to outdoor was in taiwan you don't feel like you're climbing that high up you find that oh the scenery is so nice i was really fortunate i have good friends around that climbs with me so i brought my mom along now they go on holidays they go without me when i hang out or climb with her friends i don't think i am any older than them you can do it i can do it also yeah one thing i learned from auntie dolly is i have a towel on my hunns and bedrooms the pass when i climb so that my feet don't get dirty i think she become socially younger i know not many young ones thinks that the old ones are worth mixing with they find the neggy but her friends are all very sweet they are always eat go there to help you i may slowly slowly slow down but i will not give up in fact i i clim with two senior climers both are older than me it's a matter of you stepping out of your comfort zone on you yeah i think anyone can climb i'm eighty and if i can climb anyone can climb she doesn't look to crush the hardest route but also to like support when they climb she pushes boundary i'm proud of my mother it's the first time i hear from her that she looked up to me
