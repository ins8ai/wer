the girl was asking the father why the guy is so short yeah the usual questions that kids will ask out of curiosity this is what you normally hear on the street yes it's good that kids are asking it shows that they are observant and the observation skills are pretty pretty good uh i found not about my condition when i was about four to five and i realized my classmates their body proportion were different from mila and my legs and my hands were shorter my head was bigger they started to mock at in terms of why your head is so big it did kind of really really disturb me why can't i lead a normal life does my heat um affect you like why why that comment why that question and stuff one of the biggest struggle i face every day is not able to reach things of a certain height that a normal person um can do so for example at home i will have to use a stool to reach something that is higher than me but also it trains me to find creative ways to overcome my problems people just out of curiosity as whether it's my parents born like that that's why i'm like that i don't blame them for asking because i'm more than happy to share knowledge of things that they may not be fully aware of.ä¸å¥½æ„æ€å—Ž the growing stages is much slower i only started to walk at age of four i always blame my condition for affecting my learning abilities i had to to work like harder than anyone else you affected my level of confidence to achieve certain goals the change happened when i found my patient in the dark when i was graciously accepted in a firm school the lecturers they accept me for who i am and no special treatment is given to me i do not want to be be treated specially anymore i have been pursuing phodography as a passion because i found joy in catering beautiful moments of people pass the joy over to someone else that they feel even motivated after a long week of work i feel very encouraged even though sometimes they don't say it but you know that you have done your part even through a photo or through a conversation through a word i've gone through a lot in in terms of growing in my childhood had i don't want others to to feel the same i feel that the people who are born with with this medical condition androplasia are being shelf away there has not been spoken about can this was my purpose and motivation to come out and to share about this condition one thing i will tell my younger self is to not to allow other people's comments feedback affect me take the step forward to understand myself better and to have the confidence in myself
