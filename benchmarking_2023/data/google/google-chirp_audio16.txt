so every time after smoking i will always be very happy and i really smoke and you high then they will like oh why you smoke smoke what i was like no i'm not wheat don't worry i mean i smoke the meat until i really very high very happy now hello i'm jase and i'm one of the few female peat masters in singapore and i smoke meat i was struggling and debating with myself if i call myself a smoker but i don't smoke so that's the only term that i conclude myself as a pit muster somebody who knows the equipment well there was once when i was smoking at home the meat where i took it out right that it was so soft that it sleep and fell of my hand and splatter on the ground half of it went into my fish pond i smoke about 80 to 90 kilos of briscates a week brisquet is actually very tough cut of meat in the smoking circle right kind of like the ultimate goal that everybody want to reach smoking is usually dominated by the males to carry 90 kilo of meats every week i think it's easier for males with their strength and physical build but i'm somebody who enjoy doing such things and i feel that women can also do the things that men can do i don't really have to go gym anymore already so now i think so so when i first started it was at the backyard of my house within six months i scale up into a commercial business i had like some strangers coming up to me and say that you know you are not a fnb train you are not a chef like what makes you think that you can sell your meat it's also this kind of words that make me motivate and go on further like i want to prove him wrong i also want to prove myself wrong so i will convert my energy into how i can smoke better meats when i first number upon smoking meats like online reading of people who don't sleep for 20 over hours i was like what see all these people they really crazy here who do knows like now i'm part of it so right now it has been 22 hours and the briskit is finally i think should be ready with a lot of time and patience and love when you look at the end result that's the part that you will wow out yourself and you make everybody around you like wow and i think that is like the joy of um smoking and i really i really enjoy myself when i first listed my product on my website and then i was totally sold out into seconds i realize that you know when you set your mind onto something you can just walk through it i believe that the passion the love you have the enjoyment that you have it will always be reflected in the meets and for me your heart just feels so full i think that is really the the kind of feeling that i'm looking for in whatever that i do i mean not just smoking yeah life is sure i just enjoy so i must share the happiness and joy with everybody just like how i share my food
