i think being unwanted is a thing that i should get with like my whole life your both parents do on you your adoptive parents are showing you enough love and attention so it feels like you unwanted since birth and at home growing up i used to get into this to my parents however as i grew older i learned that parent child relationships are not easy to navigate on this episode of  i speak to dewy at two years old found out she was adopted by her parents okay the first question is how do you find out you were adopted i remember i was two years old i was at the okay in my memory i remember like a dining table i remember i was so short like the dining table was like over here i was just sitting there and then like my grandmom and my mom was in the midst of a conversation then like they talk about me being adoctor then i was like huh wait i'm adopted then my mom was just kind of like yeah but then i think it was only when i grew up i go school and i realized actually everyone's mother is their real mother th i'm the only one with the what fick mother it's a very very weird feeling the thing is i still see her as my mother cuuse i still call her mommy and everything right but it's like when i see other people's parents do certain things for their kids and she don't do it right the thing that will come to my head will be oh is she not doing this cuz she's not my mom do you think like if you ever adopt children you let them know cuz i know personally that some of them might not be able to like process it i don't want them to see me the way i saw my mom because one that one ste that thought registers right and time my mom like treats me badly or anytime i feel a sense of unfairness right i'll redirect it to the fact that oh i'm a doctor next one did you feel unwanted um of course man i think being unwanted is a thing that i should with like my whole life right like in my head especially as a kid that was immature um both parents do on you your adoptive parents are showing you enough love and attention so it feels like you're unwanted since birth and at home it always feels like i have to overcompensate yeah so i think that's a reason why i'm so like quite loud i feel i have to be able to make people laugh i mean i love to make people laugh but like sometimes also feels i have to to you know have the sense of validation like hey okay i like this girl i want her to be my friend that kind of thing yeah i remember i had this one uh friend that i was very close to at the power time her mom came to pick her up and then their relationship was very like very close they were almost like best friends now i was like oh shit and i got very jealous yeah and i remember i crying the car i feel like um your childhood will still always like how you say he no matter what and especially because like i really struggled with the whole like adoption and being unwanted thing for like so long in my head of school my above parents it be like if you can't raise a kid don't give both to me and like put me in this world with this bunch of stupid parents especially my mom right it's like if you don't even show me that you love me then like why are you skoding me and treating me like that and that's why we had a very very bad relationship i felt really lonely i felt it was in secondary school right i thought myself you know what i think i'm alone in this world and i think only i can get what i want in life i think that was like the main idea and feeling that i felt like drop my teenage years i start depending on people right um i would feel like i'm losing control again so i still struggle with it like every day would you look for your biological parents i would say no now buse i don't really have time for that buse like if i find them i i know how i'll feel if i actually meet i think it'l be a mix of emotions but i feel like eventually as life go by i feel like it will be one of my life missions to really just meet who gave both to me who made me like for example i can be very emotional sometimes i can be a bit too angry sometimes i ask myself do i get these traits from my both parents so i've always wanted to like get them get to know them as a person right and see if there are any similarities between me and them and actually yeah actually i think about it i would love to get to know them as a person see how they are yeah i think the person that is angry right it's not me it's the child that inside of me but it's like if i think as present me who is a bit more much as come back to back then i don't feel angry i just feel curious but i can always feel this like anger inside of me like deep deep deep deep down i think it'l be closure for the younger me who are so angry at above mom we closure for her i don't need closure i'm good but i think she does yeah what does family mean to you i feel like i'm on the episode of baby okay no one in my family is biologically related to each other my brother is adopted but then i think to me now family is i think it's just beyond blood i think that makes us more of a family actually if you really think about it buse there are families out there that are related but they don't even treat each other like family i feel like pregnant ladies right they have nine months to register that okay they have a kid inside of them but my mom didn't have that it's just like here's a kid take care of it love it discipline it and i think my mom is quite like now i understand that like she's super strong and amazing for being able to do that but then back then i didn't understand that yeah i remember like one day i just got so drunk i drunk text my own mom i said mommy i'm so sorry i was so ungrateful i should have been more grateful i realized that if i start being grateful right maybe i will be happier and it worked right now i feel like when i think about my future it always involves my parents and my family like last time it was really selfish it was just me and my future but eventually i hope i'll be rich enough right so my father can retire cuz i always feel like my father work very very hard i want him to be able to retire at an age where he can still go out go play golf he can still enjoy life with my mom yeah that's a dream yeah would you adopt children in the future yes a big yes i love kids that's one and i still think that adoption is as beautiful as a thing as pregnancy is but then i think i will try to conceive first um if i give birth right the kid will be the first person i know or have met that is like biologically related to me yeah i think i feel like i'm not alone anymore and i think it will be the best feeling in the world cuz i and the younger me would say i finally have a family yeah is there anything you would like to tell your adoptive parents um oh shit give me a moment thank you for giving me life yeah thank you for giving me a chance to giving me the chance to live life and giving me the potential to be great at life i think even though like we went through a lot i think it really made me the person that i am today i mean yeah there are things that they could have certainly done better for sure but no one thought them to be parents and i think that they really did their best so yeah i think i owe it to them for bringing me up and people can give both the kids but to raise a kid right i think it's hard yeah they are more oftens than they are parents which says a lot yeah because not everyone can be a parent i hope you enjoyed this episode of  i hope that this episode allowed you to reflect on your own relationship with the parents as well if you enjoyed this video
