i think like last year somebody dmed me like hi can you tell something uh your photos are on like a similar like group kind of thing yeah i said like do have any screenshots so the person said no there's no screenshots but i can see you the link to join but it was a very suspiciously long link and i said you have to import your phone number i was like why welcome back to te talks and today we have not new guess like exactly but we have a new guest like exciting welcome we're going to talk a lot about scams today and how susceptible we are to scams have you guys fallen or have any encounter with scams before i've never really had a scam but i think maybe my closest interaction was that i had some like credit card uh and debit card related that fraud so basically i was overseas and then i don't what prompted me to decide to check my credit card statement which i check be like once every month or so right and then i saw like thousand plus plus deducted on my credit card and then i check my debit card and for some reason like a few other thousands deducted so i caught them and they were like okay immediately you know cancel all your cards uh we will like return you the money just like file your claims and whatever so yeah so that's scary but you got your money back i did i think the probably the scariest part was that i didn't know where it came from or like what was the source of like like you don't know how they got the numbers and correct correct cuz i mean usually you use your phone for everything nowadays right like you link your cards to your phone and then you use your phones to like buy things from like shops you scan here scan there so i think maybe it's to that but like there's really no way to verify right so right yeah no i've seen like um recent posts about people who do apps and then those like apps in turn track your bank movements or something like yeah oh my gosh i better go and look at my statement so i just like okay so i got money to eat right speaking of like the scanning qr thing there was this case i don't know if you saw on the news but yeah basically this like 60-old woman she saw an ed oh this that was like scan for like free bubble tea so she scanned it when she woke up in the morning i think twenty thousand dollars was taken from her bank account but it's exactly what went right in one night cuz yellow like the software had access to like a bank account details i would have fallen for that really yeah i've downloaded many things for free like what like what okay so far there's been no scams but if a shop tells me just download this app or just filming this survey for a free i've done everything allegedly like the woman who scan the qr code for the free buboty even though it was at a bubble tea shop the bubble tea shops say it wasn't by them oh she even get a free bubble tea she lpk thing so apparently what i read that you can do in order to protect yourself right is that if you are downloading an app you need to make sure that you are downloading from like the proper app stores which is like apple app store and google play store make sure you check that the developer details are like real and then if you had already downloaded the app what i need to do is to turn your phone to airplane mode right turn off wi-fi and then run an anti-scam application just to make sure like everything is good um you should also check whether you have any unauthorized bank transactions that has been done through another device yeah i hear now that the banks are actually rolling out this new measure to lock a certain amount that you have digitally like in a like a vault almost so it can't be digitally transferred out but if you want to like transfer money you have to probably go in person like to an atm or like a branch to like kind of like do that yeah do that big transfer so like then have you ever fell fell for any um or encounter any like fishing scams like last year somebody dmed me like hi can you take something uh your photos are on like a similar group kind of thing yeah and obviously are so scared yeah and even if you don't send any explicit pictures to people or you don't take it in general you know i mean i feel like edit or something yeah correct this fear like um did somebody record me in a changing room i said like they have any screenshots cuuse typically that's the first thing you do right yeah so the person said no there's no screenshots but i can send you the link to join and i said oh yes please i thought it would be like maybe a whatsapp group share or this kind of things but it was a very suspiciously long link with no um with not a common domain name all this so i was like okay went in and i said you have to import your phone number i was like why yeah why isn't this just a telegram group chat why like it's not that difficult to right yeah was like a bit suspicious already so i said it didn't work he said you have to put a real number i was like how do you know i didn't you i mean so creepy yeah so i was like okay this is very suspicious uh i asked around i posted on my story so a lot of people came and said like it's a scam don't fall for it's interesting though like how they take the weak spot and then they attack it you know where you are vulnerable and then they just yeah it's so common for these things to happen in singapore in terms of like um spreading pictures around you so girls always have that lingering fear it's so scary and to exploit it it's just very evil yeah the message itself was crafted in a very friendly and personal way like hi there's there's pictures of you going around this is very important could you check your messages kind of thing so like okay the conversations float very personal like it was really somebody talking to me danging no these i tell you like scams not only evolve with like technology but like like what you said like how they pray on people's vulnerabilities and um emotions as well uh to kind of like get money out of them basically someone approached this person to say that they have a job offer they're from job street and then they ask the person to give a sum of money with promise like returns i think you've heard of this yeah this case actually happened to my actual friend like i have a very close friend of mine that went through this exact sounds exactly the same so it's true oh yeah it's telegram like a conversation kind of thing she was quite skeptical initially but once she transferred right and then she saw the returns and there's this trust building basis that you go through right and once you realize actually money quite easy to earn so you there to invest a little more she continue to invest continue to give until one day the return didn't come back yeah so that was when it got really bad and they didn't get back to her and that was when she realized oh my god this is a scam because this is it i just got scammed because it's twenty k yeah it bows up to twenty k it's a lot of money she didn't twenty k gone all they can do is make a police report about it yeah do you all feel that you will fall for something like that or will blame yourselves if you do i was going to say i think previously i used to think like i know only old people for scam but i think increasingly with the scam tactics on the rice i don't want to say that i would never i think there's a high possibility that it might happen i hear that there's some ways that you can prevent these job scams which is basically if a company approaches you you should do background research on the company also don't pay to secure a job offer yeah cuz i think it's a bit weird don't fall for this like too good to be through through like um you do something small and then you get a quick b and don't give out your personal details like your phone number yeah so i think that's how you kind of at least these you can just think of these steps like yeah it yeah this app called scammy the fox icon right you've used it before oh i have it on my phone is i'll basically just install it once and then you set it up once then it prevents scammers from calling you in the first place oh yeah that's really annoying install now installing right talking about glennis um just now you're saying that this uh sharing your stories online helps to normalize conversation i was watching tik tok and then i saw a video of this girl was talking about how she got scammed by this like rental facebook marketplace rental posting so basically what happened was that she saw a posting on facebook and then she contacted the agent cuz she was interested in the viewing so the agent was like okay i know available for you to come down today but i'm not free so i get my pa to bring you so okay i'm sure so went with the pa to go and see the house actual person like an actual person oh my god to an actual house oh yeah very nice location very good price not bad th she push my luck uh ask for like a slightly lower um monthly fee then the agent very quickly yeah can can can um no problem no problem no fuck she was like no fine she was like okay be suss they started to like oh yeah can quickly sign you like if you like it today then we sign it today which is very like usually doesn't really happen that way yeah you need some discussion correct and there's like be of like b what she did was that she went to ask one of her friends who's a real estate agent to go and check like their real estate agent depository repository of like agent numbers to see the agent is real in the end couldn't find the she's like it's a scam so indian didn't sign and she got away yeah but dang that's high level speaking of shopping online you was on instagram scrolling and then this ad came out for a moon lamp basically a lamp ship like a moon okay it's quite cute like yeah it's like so like can change color and all that right so i was like oh my god it looks so nice so i was like oh my god i want to buy one week later i think i was checking and then i realized eh like no like news about my lamp coming right then i went to find the uh i don't i got receipt or something but i remember where i bought the thing from so i search online like this website and it didn't exist then um but do you like check for reviews no i just like moon i have to have it i have to have this moon put it by card details my house and i want to check out so i was like oh my god i went to check my bank account to see if there was like any other transactions but i mean don't have like it was just that moon lamp that was deducted then i was like oh damn thank god was just like the one like item yeah so if you shop online or any on any like e-commerce website please remember to check reviews and i think use payment methods yeah don't be like don't be that impulsive yeah i think reviews are nowadays i read a lot of reviews to see like i mean okay hearing all the story shared today realize that everyone of us has kind of you
