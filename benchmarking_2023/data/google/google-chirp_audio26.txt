then when they were done they opened the door and like hey oh my god hi i'm sam hi i'm happy hello i'm ch hi i'm lea and this is zula chic what is that is a chick hi guys welcome to this episode of chick chats and in today's episode we're going to be talking about staying in hall in you university so which uni were you from and which hall were you guys from i was from n t u and hotel i was from n t u also from the best hole 16 wow wow competitive i was in n u s i am in n u s and i lived in k r and and house so for me i stay in residential college so it's somewhat like a hall but it's a new town yeah and they have their own programs too yeah that's why all the nerds are at fan are cool the nets are real cool so moving on let's talk about your own personal h experience so what like rooms you stay in and also like do you have any like stories to share about like roommates or like for stories in all uh i stay in a double room so for entire i think it's good cuz you can actually choose your roommy before you going so thankfully i chose like my friend and we are still friends a lot because having a roommate right your dynamic with them completely changes that's the friendship there are stories of people who like stop being friends with their room for my first two years i stayed a roommate and then in my remaining time in hall i stay in a single room so you like single or double better i enjoy staying in a double room because i always a roommate and it didn't get very lonely on the other hand a single room is great also because like things can go my way easier like in terms of the clean up in terms of access to my room access to my rooms and yeah so you know you know yeah feel like there's some hidden message behind all these i lived in candridge for one year year one sam2 and year two sam1 and then when i did noc that was year two sam two and that was when i stayed in pgp i lived in a single room because they only have single rooms and then in the evening when the the sun just shines through my windows and sounds nice super nice and then i had all these fake flowers i stuck them around my bit frame so like it was just the dreamiest room i ever had i think for me i had the best of both walls like which is a single room but also i'm in the company of other people because i stay in a sweet that has like a shed common area but you cannot choose your sweetmates yeah so you just hangs away whether you get good roommates or not for my first year the roommates i stay with all senior so we will just like high buy but i was very very lucky when i was year to all people that i cook liquid so they are still my closest friends up to now and then i two of them were exchange students who i still keep in contact with do you have any juicy roosset stories to share i know of this couple that always appears in my friends ig story or something outside the door up for like a good five minutes before they go into the roof oh my god but actually doing on that right like the seeing into other people okay so rc is like the buildings are all built very nice like hdbs right so if you're on the top floor of this rc you can look down into the lower floor of another rc people don't realize that and then the blinds open so my friend one time he was like guys i look at my window and i just saw this couple having sex i was like what and then he was like everybody is talking about it in the chat and it's damn bad cuz like how do you tell them or so what right guys just be aware and close your blinds i think it's a very important rule i didn't see anything with my own eyes but that's what i heard i think the walls are quite thin the wall thin so when people study too hot you sometimes it can be heard when they what this thing damn hot damn hot damn hot i get what you mean by thin walls it was my friend's room i walk past her door and then i heard like oh my god hold up put my ear then i i stood with my door open then i lean against the door frame that wait for them this god the creepy then when they were done they open the door and like hey so moving on to hot activities what are some about activities that you guys participated in so the way it works in hal at least for n u s is that if you want to stay on you need to accumulate points and to accumulate points you need to participate in events functions run by either your block or your hall so i didn't join anything i'm not particularly proud about it because i feel like hall is a great way to pick up new things and new skills with which i didn't get to experience for myself cuz i was very busy talking beyond school so i couldn't really accumulate points but because i spent a lot of time with my blockmates uh they helped me to stay on for the next semester so i think rc we have the same things but we call them like interest groups at least in terms of so one of the groups that i think my friends started was t freedom which is the l g b t q plus group that supports a lot of the lgbtq plus people in the hall itself in the buso itself that's something that i feel makes the boost a little bit different in terms of like what we offer i spent a lot of time in n u s dance so like the club the n u s club itself the biggest thing that i did was to take my hor dance at the start of the year there will be a dance competition where all halls will compete together so that was really fun also i think hall is a very good place actually to try something we've never tried before in terms of commitments and goals i join as a group leader for orientation camp i was also in the hall committee something i like about ntu is we have this thing called iagg soll games inter games and there are like a lot of different kind of sports and and like recreational activities what is your biggest culture shop when you entered hall for hall and like a sheet fentry right and then that's where you realize some people are super gross have microwave oven and there are stories of people who use the oven as like to dry the sauce it's so deep if you stay in the other house please don't use the microwave but some even the uriner is quite hard sometimes it's like how it got there i think the biggest culture shock for me right was the partying culture especially at the start of the semester then they are just always like you want to go out for drinks you want to drink in my room even though it is strictly bend and people get into so much trouble and they started to clamp down very strongly towards the end of my horse day yeah oh also the sex culture so i heard of how there are whatsapp chats in hall that are just for hookups it's a rumor nobody has actually seen the chat oh you have anyway okay i mean so far i have not seen the chat but um you know little birdies that have told us about these things giving the peer pressure if people around you doing things that you don't believe in don't do it just be your own person i don't know about you but i know like in n like if something happens what the whole how about it like the next day the counting just be aware of like your actions or yeah what is your biggest take away from staying in hall i think although there's a lot of weird stories about hall and we have things that's going on i still really enjoy my stay cuz you really give me a chance to like learn how to live by my own and another big toway is definitely the friends that i meet cuz they are people who have seen you at your worst the people who you can just really knock at the door and then go inside to talk if you feel down or anything i think the biggest away for me will also be my friends these are the people who have been there for you l because they are so accessible and at the same time they are also very like i would say very likeminded lah in a way independence is one of the biggest takeaways that you're going to get cuz for the first time in my life i had a place to call my own and everything that was within this little space right belong to me and it felt so good it inspired me to one to work towards that again to someday be able to look at a place and say that i own this place the biggest theory for me is that staying in rc or even holl right made my whole uni experience a lot easier yeah because i had something to go back to all the time after like a very long day of classes and like friends who can uh kind of empathize with what i'm going through and also second thing i think it's a lot about taking initiative and learning how to like start up project and leave your own projects in the hall yeah because a lot of times you don't have the opportunity to do that outside so last question will be uh any advice to the fellow people who are entering hall in august i think anything like what they mentioned before stay true to yourself if i think still go inside with a very open mind cuz there's a lot of new experiences you going to enter into there's a lot of new things you can try new famies you can make so i think it's going to be a very exciting time none less i completely agree with whatever she has said remember to have fun so yeah because like some people they just go they just like have to just study or like a place for them to rest after school and what not but they sometimes forget about the fun aspect of of uni life while you're having fun i feel like the fun element can people might over emphasize on that sometimes as well so like those who get very into all the activities and it might become very overwhelming for you and just find your support system know who you can rely on and who you can talk through all your struggles with and it will help you a lot through your new journey i think my uh biggest advice is paradise of time because that's something a lot people don't realize cuz you know that whole triangle everyone like you want to study sleep and social life then people always choose to study and social life and then they don't like get enough time for themselves i think that is something very important don't lose yourself at all prioritizing your own mental health is key to having a great life right yeah today we talked about h culture and we learned that as long as you stay true to yourself you're going to enjoy everything and your new experiences so if you guys like this video remember to leave a comment down below and also let us know what else to talk
