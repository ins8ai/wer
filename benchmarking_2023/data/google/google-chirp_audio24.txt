one of the like hard things that i had to do was i had no idea how to change a diaper i had to learn that all by myself at the point of time i was just focused on how do i keep this baby alive hello hello nice to meet you hi hi i'm china nice to meet you nice to meet you what's your name vanessa what's your name shinda i'm alisa nice to meet you nice to meet you it's like how are you this year i'm 22 this year oh so i'm yeah my younger okay yeah the one this year so like how old were you when you found out that you were pregnant i was 17 years old when i found out i was pregnant i was still in school so yeah 17 so you were in body yeah do you still remember the moment when you found out yes i remember i was in my roommates um bathroom uh i was already leaving alone by the time i found out i was pregnant um and then i took the test and i called her in and i was just telling her like and then we just look at it at the same time and we were just freaking out how did you tell your parents that you were expecting um so i did that first with my stepfather and he broke down crying he actually blamed himself he said that if he stayed for the family or like if he had been a better father and i just i don't know how to feel i've never seen him vulnerable this is like an asian dead crying and it was just like a a rare side and even though we're not blood related he's always out there looking for me all the time so when i book the news to my mom that was ugly that was the i mean my biological parents literally talk about stoning someone you know like the old religious texts about stoning someone to death and you're like about oh um you're living insane and you're forcing me to marry this guy and um at that point of time i knew this guy was abusive and i knew for a fact that this marriage will never work out but i went along anyway because um it got really ugly to a point where um they threatened my stepfather's like work his job and i didn't want him to suffer so i got married at 17 even though i was married um i was basically a single mom cuz i was doing things on my own financially i was the main caregiver for my daughter as well so everything was just on me how did you manage to find the courage to leave your toxic marriage i've always had that one it was just more like the right time and i wasn't 21 back then so a lot of the laws were not my side especially it's like um i couldn't rent a place i would have to live in a shelter if if i didn't get married and all that so the minute that i turned 21 i just did it i i filed for divorce then there's no looking back has the thought of abortion ever like cross your mind when i found out it was positive it i was like i wanted her and i i mean i've also had friends who choose the other option and i don't judge them for it you know it's like whatever works best for your life but for me it's like at that point of time i was going through so much things and i thought like life wasn't worth you know worth it yet so when i had when i saw that line i was just i had something else to live for how was the nine months like like from the day you found all the way the whole nine months was not easy i still continued school so i went to school pregnant i remember they had to like actually um put me in a separate room because i was already due for birth oh and i still had to take exams oh my god so yeah i went to school with my biggest valley and then like i was working six drop so freelance and then i also did like telecom and i was taking up a lot of odd jobs basically just to kind of like make and meet the whole motivating factor for it was like i want my daughter to be proud of me like oh my god that's my mom my mom did that yeah and if i can do that she can do better you know that kind of thing i want i want my daughter to be able to feel like that what was the hardest part about being a mom at 17 like when you were so young at the point of time i was just focused on how do i keep this baby alive like i check on her every single hour and i was just you know i feel like i suck i'm failing all the time like sleepless nights regardless whether i was feeding her or not because even when i'm not feeding her i'm like checking on her like i used to be breathing maybe that's like mom anxiety or something like a new mom's anxiety i was on focus on my tiredness i was just trying to be a mom for me like i was raised by a single parent as well and growing up seeing my mother raise all of us by herself it was already a lot for someone who was in her mid-40s i cannot imagine what it's like for someone in their late teams um i don't know how i dealt with it because at 17 all i did was i kept myself busy and that's actually bad if you kind of look at it because i didn't give myself space to feel i did eventually feel burned out after that and it was kind of ugly and i do remember asking my mom the same thing and she was also like i i don't know how i did this yeah and i think as moms is like when you have a baby um you just have this sense of courage i mean not all moms are perfect i understand that but it's like they do everything for their baby i have a rush of feelings right now i'm just like cuz i kind of saw all of this in real time happen um when i was about nine years old i actually saw my mom have a stroke and it was from all the stress of managing like my like my family together how were you able to i think eventually make room for love for yourself so when you say make room for love it's always about loving yourself and then when your daughter sees that in you she'll do it for herself there was one time i had this conversation with my uh best friend um i was worried that why she grows up and she end up she ends up like me and um she said why is that a bad thing i don't really know how to like answer this because if i want to say like oh i don't want her to end up like me it's like shaming my myself as well for me is like i always tell myself that my love is bigger than my fears and that's where you find courage and and that's how your daughter is going to have also so i mean i understand you're also a single mom and you're doing everything on your own do you wish like you had more help like someone to like let you have a break uh i do have like the thing but then like when you take a break then you think about your child so in the end like i had to go back with my child um so mom guilt yeah kind of mom guilt you know i get what you mean yeah but i mean personally is like i've been through the whole mom guill thing you shoot like i don't care about mom guilt because i shoot i mean i know it's really hard but you need to put yourself first cuuse it's like you'll go crazy and you don't want to lose yourself while you're taking care of your kids right what do you do to make you happy what i do um cook big yeah you love to cook i love to cook oh yes what was your like dreams and aspirations before you became a mom um fmp i was actually working under fmp oh okay yeah so i love like in that sector you know get to meet peoples you get to cook maybe one day um make it as a f&b like home business then like another thing will be like maybe social work social work okay do you not have enough crazy in your life like that's the last thing ever after i became a mom it's like no i do feel like also the stereotype of single teen mom just i feel like people tend to categorize these sort of people as very very promiscuous very careless have you ever had these sort of encounters before oh all the time i'm telling you like when i was single i had guys telling me like oh you're just good to you just you're just good yeah you're just goods for a for a for a night they were like saying oh you're you're at the bottom of the uh of the chain you're literally a single tin mal um and you're like saying no one's gonna ever marry you but you know it's like everyone has a different starting line and single moms might be at the back cuz everyone else is like at the at the front and it's not a race it's just a journey so i really don't care about what they want to say about whether i'm promiscuous or not it's like as long as i continue to improve myself i continue to help the people around me and the people who also has gone through the same thing as me i did my part what's your daughter's name uh my daughter's name is amelia yeah she's 4 years old so like was she what got you to like the toughest days like even up to now can i be honest yeah i mean i love my baby but sometimes they are the reason for your tougher days but but yeah the thing that got me through is like i would this may sound like so self absorbed but it was me it's like you pr to mental health take a break and then you're back yeah so it's like she is my main motivation and drive but like day to day when it gets hot it's like you need time to kind of relax and take your mind off and like have alone time yeah i mean after everything that you went through with like emilia you still want more kids i eventually did find love i met my husband now he is like he has to be the best of the best cuz um i really i'm traumatized so my expectation is always there um he exceeded all of it and he's like shrek do you watch shrek yeah i love shrek okay yeah yeah like okay he's grumppy as hell but he's really like you keep the right person i don't no no like lookswise looks wise wait what he looks like no no no oh looks wise he's attend but like his personality is shrek okay and yeah he's been very supportive he's i was emotional and he was always trying to be present and there for me all time yeah and he's not afraid to change diapers i mean i know again the minimum but he's really out putting himself out there so he's really like putting in a lot a lot of effort yeah so uh i have another son now he's four months old uh his name is michael and amelia has been a very protective sister like literally would smack you if you take her brother way so cute uh i don't know about the cute part but yeah she will like literally look at you up to up down just to yeah are you worthy of my brother oh yeah it's very protective like that was there any difficulty in introducing her to like the your new um partner at the beginning um usually she don't like people but when i first like introduced my then boyfriend to her no husband um she immediately warmed up yeah when she around him she was just i don't she feels very safe to just be herself i mean it was her on her own initiative to call her papa yeah after we started dating a few months currently my dad is trying to talk to me he's not been in my life for about 15 years so you know he'll occasionally send me messages asking me how i am but i normally ignore them um would you want your daughter to maintain a rela relationship with her birth father um that for now when she's too young to make a decision for herself i would step in and tell her not now definitely i do not want her to maintain a relationship with her until she's old enough and i'm confident that she can make good decisions on her own if the father still wants to kind of have that relationship with her he's got to learn how to love that girl yeah because you left that little girl so now you have to wait until she's old enough for her to be able to stand up on her own and make her own choices again it's my daughter's choice i wouldn't want to impose that on her but at least for this age it's like i need to make the right choices for her yeah what's your daughter's name rosavel rosavel it's a nice name it's like a princess name i even gave the mido nimm like j oh cuz she's precious as a germ so cute yeah what's the best part of being a mom best part being with mom being with her seeing her growth just yesterday um like the teacher just called me up for parents teacher meeting and she was like telling me you nosabel she's very loving and caring her friend for now she just hug so it's like i felt very very happy with her yeah yeah do you feel the most happiest when you with your kid yes most of the time it's like um it's happy and then stressed and then happy i mean the best thing that i really love to do with her is just listening to her talk and i just love to see how a tiny brain just works it's just like the different phases of of their growth it's just like every part of it is great it's like they grow up so fast it's like one month later you have a whole new different kid and you just have to fall in love with that kid all over again so i'm just enjoying every version of them that they are becoming for now are you happy now definitely i mean i've been through hell and bad and i've always been happy it was just like how you look at it
