when i was at my peak i spend most whatever i earn it got nice coding i own couple of luxury watches during the lowest point of my life i was homeless and i i never tell anyone because i was very embas for a couple of days i go to ch but i was thinking question to myself you know what can i do to get myself out of this see some people they are very good with me yeah i'm not good with me but i'm good at the dreaming that's my biggest talent the dreaming i do love creative work that i like to travel yeah and i like images i shoot everything i go to bus stop public area i just shoot randomly i learn aesthetic from there I don't go to film school but i got lucky yeah in a way right because i meet the right people so i met this japanese boss muri he sent me right to japanese construction in singapore at that point i get quite good income because it's hard to penetrate japanese construction i never see this kind amount of money before no financially lah i'm not thought how to say money my circle of friends they come for money lah yeah so they go party they have nice cars and so on i was influenced by my surrounding then i got to watches like omega rolex at one point i was singing a good lifelah But life is not a bit of roses after eight years movie pass on things get bad then covid started right uh everything disrupted especially the construction area i was a freelancer about a year plus project getting lesser and lesser so i don't have enough income time i sold everything i don't have any more camera i have just enough money to buy a 10 then with me just a small little bag remember one time i caught my mom so my mom asked me hey where are you how are you i say i'm good my friend place thinking maybe my son is doing quite good no yeah somewhere because i sudden see my mom i feel like i'm let down that point i was really hungry and people next to me they are barbecuing that is the saddest part of my life one day uh i feel a pain in my ear when i close my eyes i can see red blue purple you know so i didn't actually something is happening inside my my head i was woddered so i was diagnosed with stroke due to my condition it was very hard for me to apply for a job when i was hospitalized i met this social worker connected me to nowhere my first impression i thought he's a young man yeah because when he spoke to me he sounds very jov energetic he tell me that not to worry because he's there to guide me and help me revemp my resume which is audited lah raffik in terms of his personality he's a fighter he's a survivor so he went to do grab he went jobs that comes his way so this is something that i really admire him when he shared with me his situation i was able to empathise with him and i guess that also helped him to move on because he had a listening year and from there he can work towards getting employment most of my life now uh i'm alone i'm on my own you know it's like a heaven snow when nobel called me because at that time i was quite desperate you know one thing that noticed is grown in terms of this confidence right and and what i see is along the way he bks faster from with the help now well i led a job yes so this is actually much needed lah for me to support myself the way i describe my life is like a roller coaster because there be a lot of ups and a lot of downs but you have to be kind to yourself and acknowledge your weakness and have faith so i accept my situation now i cannot get back whatever i lost in the past ya so what i can do is just look ahead and make my life better now i'm looking forward to my coming bto so i always wanted to have my own home so i'm very happy and i'm looking forward to be living in that house my name is ruffy and i'm 51 years old and i'm doing my best ya in life
